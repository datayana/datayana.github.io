MND is a commentary on Snp4
CND is a commentary on Snp5

plan:
1. pick up all instances of the matika in CND (easier) from https://zacanger.com/niddesa/assets/niddesa.html
2. figure out the section in CND it comes from
3. note any reference similar to "know for yourself"
4. trace back to the section in Snp5
5. note context from both CND and Snp5

## "know for yourself" => "the one who knows" ?

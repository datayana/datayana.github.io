# Appendix

MND is a commentary on Snp4
CND is a commentary on Snp5

plan:
1. pick up all instances of the matika in CND (easier) from https://zacanger.com/niddesa/assets/niddesa.html
2. figure out the section in CND it comes from
3. note any reference similar to "know for yourself"
4. trace back to the section in Snp5
5. note context from both CND and Snp5

TODO:
1. get an exaustive list of all occurences of the matika
2. pick in context something corresponding to "know for yourself"
3. regroup those and search for relationships in other texts


# A. Occurences of the matika on the grounds for the acceptance of a teaching

In this section, we're looking for occurences of the matika formed by the ten grounds for the acceptance of a teaching.

This matika is used in [AN3.65 Kalama Sutta](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/en/sujato):

> Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.

corresponding in [pali](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/pli/ms) to:

## AN3.66 - Sāḷhasutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/an3.66/en/sujato

> “Please, Sāḷha and friend, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.

> “Etha tumhe, sāḷhā, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭakasampadānena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāraparivitakkena, mā diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā samaṇo no garūti.

### Notes

This time the discourse is given by Venerable Nandaka to Salha and Rohana. Nandaka starts directly by saying to Salha this paragraph seen in [AN3.65](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/pli/ms) (_"Come, Salha, do not go by..."_).

Then Nandaka unfolds the same reasoning as in AN3.65: we need to abandon practices and views rooted in greed [lobha], aversion [dosa] and delusion [moha], and that lead to suffering.

This time, greed [lobha] is said to mean "longing" [abhijjhā], and that longing leads to wrong deeds. Aversion [dosa] is said to mean "ill will" [byāpāda], idem. And delusion [moha] is said to mean "ignorance" [avijjā].

In this sutta, Nandaka doesn't mention the four assurances. Instead, he says that the noble disciple, as a reward of abandoning greed, aversion, delusion, understands thus: _"There is this; there is the inferior; there is the superior; there is a further escape from whatever is involved with perception."_ And he is liberated from taints.

note 462 ref to [MN7.17](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn7/) four divine abodes?

B. Bodhi, in his translationof AN, 2012, note 462 p 1654, adds that the commentary (Anguttara Nikaya-atthakatha) establishes a relation between these four and the four noble truths:
- "there is this": five aggregates, truth of suffering
- "inferior": truth of the origin of suffering
- "superior": truth of the path
- "further escape": nibbana, truth of cessation


## AN4.193 - Bhaddiyasutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/an4.193/en/sujato

> “Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when **you know for yourselves**: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.

Pali extract: https://suttacentral.net/an4.193/pli/ms

> “Etha tumhe, bhaddiya, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭakasampadānena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāraparivitakkena, mā diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā ‘samaṇo no garū’ti. Yadā tumhe, bhaddiya, **attanāva jāneyyātha**: ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, bhaddiya, pajaheyyātha.

### Notes

In this sutta, Baddhiya comes to the Buddha because he heard that _"the ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects"_ ([B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, p567], see also note 907 ref to [SN42.13](https://suttacentral.net/pi/sn42.13) and [MN56.8](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn56)).

The Buddha dispells how _"some ascetics and brahmins untruthfully, baselessly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresent [him]"_ by saying this. He uses the same sutta as in AN 3.65 to show what his conversion is about: abandoning practices and views rooted in greed [lobha], aversion [dosa] and delusion [moha], and that lead to suffering (with vehemence [sārambha] added in the mix).

This time the Buddha doesn't mention the four assurances. But he asks Baddhiya: _"did I say to you: 'Come, Bhaddiya, be my disciple and I will be your teacher'?"_. Bhaddiya says no. The emphasis seems to be on the choice Bhaddiya made to go to the Buddha for refuge on his own.

After having said how beneficial it would be for basically everyone to convert that way (in note 911, B. Bodhi refers to MN56.26 at this point), at the very end of the sutta, there is this interesting paragraph:

> "If these great sal trees would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to the welfare and happiness even of these great sal trees for a long time, if they could choose. How much more then for a human being!" [B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, p 570]

_Note: B. Bodhi note 912 mentions that "sace ceteyyum" ("if they could choose") is found in Sinhala-script and Roman-script but not Burmese-script._


## SN12.68 - Kosambisutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/sn12.68/en/sujato

> “Reverend Musīla, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you **know for yourself** that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?”
> 
> “Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I **know and see** that rebirth is a condition for old age and death.”

Pali extract: https://suttacentral.net/sn12.68/pli/ms

> “aññatreva, āvuso musila, saddhāya aññatra ruciyā aññatra anussavā aññatra ākāraparivitakkā aññatra diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā **atthāyasmato musilassa paccattameva ñāṇaṁ**: ‘jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇan’”ti?
> 
> “Aññatreva, āvuso paviṭṭha, saddhāya aññatra ruciyā aññatra anussavā aññatra ākāraparivitakkā aññatra diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā **ahametaṁ jānāmi ahametaṁ passāmi**: ‘jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇan’”ti.

### Notes

This sutta reports an exchange happening between the four Venerables Musila, Savittha, Narada and Ananda.

Savittha asks Musila the following question: _"Friend Musila, apart from faith, apart from personal preference, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned reflexion, apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it, does the Venerable Musila have personal knowledge thus: 'With birth as condition, aging-and-death [comes to be]?'"_ [B. Bodhi, SN, p. 612]

This unfolds along the list of factors of dependent origination. And the final point is Savittha saying _"**I know this, I see this**: 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence'"_. To that sentence, Musila concludes that Savittha is an Arahant.

But Narada interrupts. And an exchange of the same kind unfolds into a discussion on the point that it is not enough to know and see 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence' to be an arahant. That one needs also to extinguish all taints related to this view, to make "bodily contact" with this truth (use of a simile).

In his notes, B.Bodhi points to a discussion on the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis" [B. Bodhi, SN, note 198, p 781] which are here put in comparison with "Personal knowledge" [paccattameva ñāṇa], and are also criticized in SN35.153 (see below):
- faith [saddhā]
- personal preference [ruci]
- oral tradition [anussavā]
- reasoned reflexion [ākāraparivitakkā]
- acceptance of a view after pondering itth [diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti]

## SN35.153 - Atthi­nu­kho­pariyā­ya­sutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/sn35.153/en/sujato

> “There is a method—apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration—that a mendicant can rely on to declare their enlightenment. That is: ‘I **understand**: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’
> 
> And what is that method? Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. When they have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they **understand** ‘I have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’ When they don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they understand ‘I don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’ Since this is so, are these things understood by faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration?”
> 
> “No, sir.”
> 
> “Aren’t they **understood by seeing them with wisdom**?”
> 
> “Yes, sir.”

### Notes

Pointed out in [B. Bodhi, SN, note 198, p 781] as another sutta criticizing the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis".

In this sutta, the investigation deals with **how a Bhikkhu can declare** [] - 'Detroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being'.

The answer the Buddha provides is related to one, having seen a form, a sound with the ear... a mental phenomenon with the mind, "sees with wisdom" [dhammā paññāya disvā veditabbā] that there is no lust, hatred or delusion [lobha, dosa, moha] internally.


## MN76 - Sandakasutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/mn76/en/sujato

> Furthermore, take another teacher who is an oral transmitter, who takes oral transmission to be the truth. He teaches by oral transmission, by the lineage of testament, by canonical authority. But when a teacher takes oral transmission to be the truth, some of that is well learned, some poorly learned, some true, and some otherwise.

Pali extract: https://suttacentral.net/mn76/pli/ms

> Puna caparaṁ, sandaka, idhekacco satthā anussaviko hoti anussavasacco. So **anussavena** **itihitihaparamparāya** **piṭakasampadāya** dhammaṁ deseti. Anussavikassa kho pana, sandaka, satthuno anussavasaccassa sussutampi hoti dussutampi hoti tathāpi hoti aññathāpi hoti.

### Notes

The Blessed One is named "the Blessed One who knows and sees".

Ananda speaks to an assembly of wanderer led by Sandaka. He teaches about the four ways that negate the living of the holy life.

1. Holding the view "there is nothing give, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this world, no other world [...]",
2. Holding the view "when one acts or makes other act [...], no evil is done by the doer" and no outcome of evil,
3. Holding the view "there is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled withotu cause or condition; there is no cause or condition for the purification of beings, beings are purified withotu cause or condition; [...] all beings, all living things, all creatures, all souls are without mastery, power, energy",
4. Holding the view "there are these seven bodies that are unmade, not brought forth, uncreated, without a creator, [these are earth, water, fire, air, pleasure, pain, soul]; herein there is no killer, no slaughterer, no hearer, no speaker; [...] the round of rebirths is limited, there is no shortening or extending it, no increasing or decreasing it".

Those are clearly related to different doctrines of morality, cause and effect / karma.

Ananda then teaches about the four kind of holy life without consolate, wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life, or if he should live it, would not attain the true way.

1. "some teacher claims to be omniscient and all-seeing", when asked "how is this?" he replies "I had to...",
2. "some teacher is a traditionalist, one who regards oral tradition as truth; he teaches a Dhamma by oral tradition, by legends handed down, by the authority of the collections",
3. a certain teacher is a reasoner, an inquirer; he teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, following a line of inquiry as it occurs to him",
4. "a certain teacher is dull and confused; [...] when he is asked such and such a question, he engages in verbal wriggling, in eel-wriggling".

"So when [the teacher] finds that this holy life is without consolation, he turns away from it and leaves it."

Ananda then speaks of the Tathagata, how the Tathagata went through all jhanas (unfolding this matika in the sutta, as in MN51). The sutta concludes on the description of the Arahant.


## MN95 - Caṅkīsutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/mn95/en/sujato

> “Master Gotama, regarding that which by the lineage of testament and by canonical authority is the ancient hymnal of the brahmins, the brahmins come to the definite conclusion: ‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ What do you say about this?”
> 
> “Well, Bhāradvāja, is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this: ‘**I know this, I see this**: this is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”
> 
“No, Master Gotama.”
> 
> [...]
> 
> “The brahmins don’t just honor this because of faith, but also because of oral transmission.”
> 
> “First you relied on faith, now you speak of oral tradition. These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways. What five? Faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, and acceptance of a view after consideration. Even though you have full faith in something, it may be void, hollow, and false. And even if you don’t have full faith in something, it may be true and real, not otherwise.

### Notes

The Buddha is being asked questions by a brahmin student Kapathika. It is said that this student is a sixteen years old clansman, "a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology and grammar, fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man", very learned, has good delivery and is wise.

Kapathika asks (B. Bodhi trans.): "In regard to the ancient brahmanic hymns that have come down through oral transmission preserved in the collections the brahmins come to the definite conclusion: 'only this is true, anything else is wrong.' What does the Master Gotama say about this?"

The Buddha replies that none of those brahmins **knows and sees** 'only this is true, anything else is wrong'. Thus placing the discussion about the method to access knowledge, and not the knowledge itself.

He then proceeds with criticizing five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis (faith, personal preference, oral tradition, reasoned reflexion, acceptance of a view after pondering it).

After this, Kapathika asks: "How does one preserve truth?" (_saccānurakkhana_ or safeguarding the truth), meaning how can one speak about some view without relying on those grounds?

The Buddha explains: "He says 'my faith is thus'; but he does not yet come to the definite conclusion: 'only this is true, anything else is wrong'". Same for oral tradition ('my oral tradition is thus'), and reflective acceptance ('my reflective acceptance is thus').

The sutta goes on with explaining how does one discover the truth. The follower investigates a bhikkhu in regard to stats based on greed, hate or delusion. If the bikkhu is purified from states based on greed, hate or delusion, then follows another matika describing a following discovering the truth.

The follower: 
- places faith in the bikkhu,
- visits him,
- pays respect,
- gives ear to him,
- hears the Dhamma,
- memorises the Dhamma,
- examines the meaning () of the teachings he has memorized,
- gains a reflective acceptance ()
- zeals springs up and then,
- he applies his will,
- he scrutinises,
- he strives,
- he realises with the body the surpreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.

"The final arrival at truth lies in the repetition, development, and cultivation of those same things."

Faith being the first step here, is the faith in the teacher, after examining the teacher is purified from greed, hate and delusion.


## TODO: MN102 - Pañ­catta­yasutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/mn102/en/sujato

> Now, consider the ascetics and brahmins whose view is as follows. ‘The self and the cosmos are eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ It’s simply not possible for them to have purified and clear personal knowledge of this, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration. And in the absence of such knowledge, even the partial knowledge that they are clear about is said to be grasping on their part. ‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—that is real.’ Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.

Pali extract: https://suttacentral.net/mn102/pli/ms

### Notes

Basing acceptance of a thesis on the five grounds (faith, personal preference, oral tradition, reasoned reflexion, acceptance of a view after pondering it) would be considered as clinging to a wrong view.

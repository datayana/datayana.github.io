plan:
1. pick up all instances of the matika in CND (easier) from https://zacanger.com/niddesa/assets/niddesa.html
2. figure out the section in CND it comes from
3. note any reference similar to "know for yourself"
4. trace back to the section in Snp5
5. note context from both CND and Snp5

### CND 4 - Mettagu

https://zacanger.com/niddesa/assets/niddesa.html#mettag%C5%AB

> 19 · [The Blessed One: “Mettagū!”]  
> You ask me about the occurrence of suffering,  
> And I will say that for you as one who knows:  
> All sufferings occur due to dependence,  
> Of all types of different forms in the world.  
> 
> “You ask me about the occurrence of suffering”: Suffering, bitterness, old age, sickness, death, sadness, desperation, and sorrow. You ask, you ask about the cause of suffering, you ask about the root, you ask about arising, you ask about happening, you ask about waiting, you ask about the nutriment, you ask about the object, you ask about the condition, you ask about the collection, you ask strongly, you ask, beg, request, make it clear. “Mettagū,” the Blessed One called the Brāhmaṇa by his name. “Blessed One,” this is a respectful synonym… (omitted).
> 
> “I will say that for you as the one who knows”: “That,” I will explain the cause of suffering, …the root, arising, production, …(omitted); I will explain, I will teach… (omitted). “As the one who knows,” such as the one who knows, the one who understands, the one who penetrates, not from hearsay, not from rumors, not from inheritance, not from scripture, not from logic, not from reasoning, not because of theoretical contemplation, not because of the insights accepted after contemplation; a method that is personally proven and self-proven by oneself, I will say that.

> 22 · [The Blessed One: “Mettagū!”]  
> I will tell you the Dhamma, known in real life and not through rumors;  
> Anyone who knows it, living mindfully,  
> Can cross over love (desire) in the world.  
> 
> “I will tell you the Dhamma”: “Dhamma,” the beginning is good, the middle is good, and the end is good; the meaning is correct, the phrase is correct; only the perfect and pure Brāhmaṇa line: four mindfulnesses, four righteousness, four divine bases, five senses, five powers, seven enlightenment factors, eight holy paths, Nibbāna and the path leading to Nibbāna; I will tell, I will explain, I will teach, I will reveal, I will analyze, I will clarify. “Mettagū,” the Blessed One called the Brāhmaṇa by his name.
> 
> “In the current life and not in rumors”: “In the current life,” in the seen, in the known, in the measured, in the made clear: “All actions are impermanent”… (omitted) “any collection of dhammas is an extinction of dhammas” means in the Dhamma that is seen (in the current life), in the Dhamma that is known, in the Dhamma that is measured, in the Dhamma that is made clear; this is what I will talk about, in the real life. Or, I will tell you about the suffering which is seen, I will tell you about the collection which is seen, I will tell you the way which is seen, I will tell you about the extinction of what is seen, and this is what I will talk about, in the present. Or, in the life as directly visible, instant, inviting you to see, able to guide, and the wise should experience it by themselves; this is what I will talk about, in this life. “Not rumors,” not anecdotal, not from hearsay, not from inheritance, not from scripture, not from logical inference, not from reasoning, not because of theoretical reflection, not because of an opinion received after reflection, but by oneself. The known and self-evidenced Dhamma, I will talk about that.
> 
> “Anyone who, after knowing, is mindful”: After knowing, weighing, judging, separating, clarifying: “All actions are impermanent” after knowing, …(omitted). “Mindful,” there are four ways to be mindful: when practicing mindfulness on the body, when practicing mindfulness on perception, when watching the mind in the heart, when the practice is in line with the teachings, it is mindful.
> 
> And again in four ways: the state of avoiding non-mind, the state of the Dhamma that should be done to the mind, the state of the Dhamma that is obstructed by the mind, the state of the mindfulness factor (phase) not being forgotten.
> 
> And again in four ways: the state of possessing mindfulness, the state of abiding in mindfulness, the state of experiencing mindfulness, and the state of mindfulness not lowering.
> 
> And again in four ways: with the state of being mindful as the object of mindfulness, the quiet state as the object, the calm state as the object, the state of silence; the recollection of the Buddha, the recollection of the Dhamma, the recollection of the Saṅgha, the precepts, the alms, of the mind; mindfulness of the in and out breath, of death, of the body, of silence; all mindfulness, free-mindfulness…, the path without a fork, are called mindfulness. Having been fully possessed, reaching fully, possessing, arriving, with this thought, he is called mindful. “Living,” when you go, live, act, guard, exist, survive.
> 
> “Able to cross through love in the world”: “Love” is called craving, which is greed, …(omitted) unwholesome roots. “Being in love,” what does it mean to be loving? The “spread” is love, the “broad” is love, the “vast” is love, the “incorrect” is love, “it forces” is love, “it seizes” is love, “fraud” is love, “poisonous root” is love, “poisonous fruit” is love, “poison is used” is love; or, “the vast thirst for love”: in form…, sound…, smell…, taste… (omitted), the material realm, the formless realm, the desire realm, the four constituents, the five endowments, past, future, now, the enlarged attachments in the dhammas that are seen, heard, felt, and knowable, are love. “In the world,” in the world of suffering, in the world of humans, (omitted)…, and in the world of being. “Able to survive the love in the world”: “The love in the world, he can pass through, surpass, pass, transcend, and overcome mindfully” [Ni.1].

“The self-evidenced method of distress adjustment”: “Self-evidenced method,” not from rumors, not from inheritance, not from scripture, not from logic, not from reasoning, not because of theoretical contemplation, not because of the insights accepted after contemplation; a method that is personally proven and self-proven by oneself.

His insights were seen and understood in the Dhamma that he personally proved and realized.

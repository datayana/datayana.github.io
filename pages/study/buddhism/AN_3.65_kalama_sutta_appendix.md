# Appendix

MND is a commentary on Snp4
CND is a commentary on Snp5

plan:
1. pick up all instances of the matika in CND (easier) from https://zacanger.com/niddesa/assets/niddesa.html
2. figure out the section in CND it comes from
3. note any reference similar to "know for yourself"
4. trace back to the section in Snp5
5. note context from both CND and Snp5

TODO:
1. get an exaustive list of all occurences of the matika
2. pick in context something corresponding to "know for yourself"
3. regroup those and search for relationships in other texts


# A. Occurences of the matika on the acceptance of a teaching

In this section, we're looking for occurences of the matika formed by the ten grounds for the acceptance of a teaching, as stated in [AN3.65 Kalama Sutta](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/en/sujato):

> Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.

corresponding in [pali](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/pli/ms) to:

## AN3.66 - 66. Sāḷhasutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/an3.66/en/sujato

> “Please, Sāḷha and friend, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.

Pali extract: https://suttacentral.net/an3.66/pli/ms

> “Etha tumhe, sāḷhā, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭakasampadānena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāraparivitakkena, mā diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā samaṇo no garūti. Yadā tumhe, sāḷhā, **attanāva jāneyyātha** ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, sāḷhā, pajaheyyātha.

### Notes

This time the discourse is given by Venerable Nandaka to Salha and Rohana. Nandaka starts directly by saying to Salha this paragraph seen in [AN3.65](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/pli/ms) (_"Come, Salha, do not go by..."_).

Then Nandaka unfolds the same reasoning as in AN3.65: abandoning practices and views rooted in greed [lobha], aversion [dosa] and delusion [moha], and that lead to suffering.

This time, greed [lobha] is said to mean "longing" [abhijjhā], and that longing leads to wrong deeds. Aversion [dosa] is said to mean "ill will" [byāpāda], idem. And delusion [moha] is said to mean "ignorance" [avijjā].

In this sutta, Nandaka doesn't mention the four assurances. Instead, he says that the noble disciple, as a reward of abandoning greed, aversion, delusion, understands thus: _"There is this; there is the inferior; there is the superior; there is a further escape from whatever is involved with perception."_ And he is liberated from taints.

note 462 ref to [MN7.17](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn7/) four divine abodes?

[B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, note 462 p 1654] adds that the commentary (Anguttara Nikaya-atthakatha) establishes a relation between these four and the four noble truths:
- "there is this": five aggregates, truth of suffering
- "inferior": truth of the origin of suffering
- "superior": truth of the path
- "further escape": nibbana, truth of cessation


## AN4.193 - 193. Bhaddiyasutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/an4.193/en/sujato

> “Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when **you know for yourselves**: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.

Pali extract: https://suttacentral.net/an4.193/pli/ms

> “Etha tumhe, bhaddiya, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭakasampadānena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāraparivitakkena, mā diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā ‘samaṇo no garū’ti. Yadā tumhe, bhaddiya, **attanāva jāneyyātha**: ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, bhaddiya, pajaheyyātha.

### Notes

In this sutta, Baddhiya comes to the Buddha because he heard that _"the ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects"_ ([B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, p567], see also note 907 ref to [SN42.13](https://suttacentral.net/pi/sn42.13) and [MN56.8](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn56)). The Buddha dispells how "some ascetics and brahmins untruthfully, baselessly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresent [him]" by saying this. He uses the same sutta as in AN 3.65 to show what his conversion is about: abandoning practices and views rooted in greed [lobha], aversion [dosa] and delusion [moha], and that lead to suffering (with vehemence [sārambha] added in the mix).

This time the Buddha doesn't mention the four assurances. But he asks Baddhiya: _"did I say to you: 'Come, Bhaddiya, be my disciple and I will be your teacher'?"_. Bhaddiya says no. The emphasis seems to be on the choice Bhaddiya made to go to the Buddha for refuge on his own.

After having said how beneficial it would be for basically everyone to convert that way (in note 911, B. Bodhi refers to MN56.26 at this point), at the very end of the sutta, there is this interesting paragraph:
> "If these great sal trees would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to the welfare and happiness even of these great sal trees for a long time, if they could choose. How much more then for a human being!" [B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, p 570]

_Note: B. Bodhi note 912 mentions that "sace ceteyyum" ("if they could choose") is found in Sinhala-script and Roman-script but not Burmese-script._


## SN12.68 - 68. Kosambisutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/sn12.68/en/sujato

> “Reverend Musīla, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you **know for yourself** that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?”
> 
> “Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I **know and see** that rebirth is a condition for old age and death.”

Pali extract: https://suttacentral.net/sn12.68/pli/ms

> “aññatreva, āvuso musila, saddhāya aññatra ruciyā aññatra anussavā aññatra ākāraparivitakkā aññatra diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā **atthāyasmato musilassa paccattameva ñāṇaṁ**: ‘jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇan’”ti?
> 
> “Aññatreva, āvuso paviṭṭha, saddhāya aññatra ruciyā aññatra anussavā aññatra ākāraparivitakkā aññatra diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā **ahametaṁ jānāmi ahametaṁ passāmi**: ‘jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇan’”ti.

### Notes

This sutta reports an exchange happening between the four Venerables Musila, Savittha, Narada and Ananda.

Savittha asks Musila the following question:

> Friend Musila, apart from faith, apart from personal preference, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned reflexion, apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it, does the Venerable Musila have personal knowledge thus: 'With birth as condition, aging-and-death [comes to be]?' [B. Bodhi, SN, p. 612]

This unfolds along the list of factors of dependent origination. And the final point is Savittha saying "I know this (TODO: which "know" here?), I see this: 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence'". To that sentence, Musila concludes that Savittha is an Arahant.

But Narada interrupts. And an exchange of the same kind unfolds into a discussion on the point that it is not enough to know and see 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence' to be an arahant. That one needs also to extinguish all taints related to this view, to make "bodily contact" with this truth (use of a simile).

In his notes, B.Bodhi points to a discussion on the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis" [B. Bodhi, SN, note 198, p 781] which are here put in comparison with "Personal knowledge" [paccattameva ñāṇa], and are also criticized in SN35.153 (see below):
- faith [saddhā]
- personal preference [ruci]
- oral tradition [anussavā]
- reasoned reflexion [ākāraparivitakkā]
- acceptance of a view after pondering itth [diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti]

TODO: See Gombrich, How Buddhism Began, 1996, pp 128-29


## SN35.153 - 153. Atthi­nu­kho­pariyā­ya­sutta

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/sn35.153/en/sujato

> “There is a method—apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration—that a mendicant can rely on to declare their enlightenment. That is: ‘I **understand**: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’
> 
> And what is that method? Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. When they have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they **understand** ‘I have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’ When they don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they understand ‘I don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’ Since this is so, are these things understood by faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration?”
> 
> “No, sir.”
> 
> “Aren’t they **understood by seeing them with wisdom**?”
> 
> “Yes, sir.”

Pali extract: https://suttacentral.net/sn35.153/pli/ms

> “atthi, bhikkhave, pariyāyo yaṁ pariyāyaṁ āgamma bhikkhu aññatreva saddhāya, aññatra ruciyā, aññatra anussavā, aññatra ākāraparivitakkā, aññatra diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā aññaṁ byākareyya: ‘“khīṇā jāti, vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ, kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ, nāparaṁ itthattāyā”ti **pajānāmī**’ti.

> “Evaṁ, bhante”.

### Notes

Pointed out in [B. Bodhi, SN, note 198, p 781] as another sutta criticizing the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis".

In this sutta, the investigation related to **how a Bhikkhu can declare** [] - 'Detroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being'.

The answer the Buddha provides is related to one, having seen a form, a sound with the ear... a mental phenomenon with the mind, "sees with wisdom" [dhammā paññāya disvā veditabbā] that there is no lust, hatred or delusion [lobha, dosa, moha] internally.


## MN102 - Pañ­catta­yasutta [[link](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn102/)]

English extract: https://suttacentral.net/mn102/en/sujato

> Now, consider the ascetics and brahmins whose view is as follows. ‘The self and the cosmos are eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ It’s simply not possible for them to have purified and clear personal knowledge of this, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration. And in the absence of such knowledge, even the partial knowledge that they are clear about is said to be grasping on their part. ‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—that is real.’ Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.

Pali extract: https://suttacentral.net/mn102/pli/ms

> Tatra, bhikkhave, ye te samaṇabrāhmaṇā evaṁvādino evaṁdiṭṭhino: ‘sassato attā ca loko ca, idameva saccaṁ moghamaññan’ti, tesaṁ vata aññatreva saddhāya aññatra ruciyā aññatra anussavā aññatra ākāraparivitakkā aññatra diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā paccattaṁyeva ñāṇaṁ bhavissati parisuddhaṁ pariyodātanti—netaṁ ṭhānaṁ vijjati.

### Notes

Basing acceptance of a thesis on the five grounds (faith, personal preference, oral tradition, reasoned reflexion, acceptance of a view after pondering it) would be considered as clinging to a wrong view.

> Anyone who knows it, living mindfully,  
> Can cross over love (desire) in the world.  
> 
> “I will tell you about the stillness”: The stillness of greed, the stillness of aversion, …(omitted), the stillness of all unwholesome creations; silence, cessation; I will tell, announce, say, explain, teach, interpret, build, uncover, parse, clarify.
> 
> “[The Blessed One: ‘Dhotaka’]”: “Dhotaka,” the World Venerable calls the Brāhmaṇa by his name. “Blessed One,” …(omitted).
> 
> **“In the current life and not from hearsay”**: “In the current life,” in the seen, in the known, in the measured, in the made clear: “All actions are impermanent”… (omitted) “any collection of dhammas is an extinction of dhammas” means in the Dhamma that is seen (in the current life), in the Dhamma that is known, in the Dhamma that is measured, in the Dhamma that is made clear; this is what I will talk about, in the real life. Or, I will tell you about the suffering which is seen, I will tell you about the collection which is seen, I will tell you the way which is seen, I will tell you about the extinction of what is seen, and this is what I will talk about, in the present. Or, in the life as directly visible, instant, inviting you to see, able to guide, and the wise should experience it by themselves; this is what I will talk about, in this life. **“Not rumors,” not anecdotal, not from hearsay, not from inheritance, not from scripture, not from logical inference, not from reasoning, not because of theoretical reflection, not because of an opinion received after reflection, but by oneself. The known and self-evidenced Dhamma**, I will talk about that.

> 
> “Able to cross through love in the world”: “Love” is called craving, which is greed, …(omitted) unwholesome roots. “Being in love,” what does it mean to be loving? The “spread” is love, the “broad” is love, the “vast” is love, the “incorrect” is love, “it forces” is love, “it seizes” is love, “fraud” is love, “poisonous root” is love, “poisonous fruit” is love, “poison is used” is love; or, “the vast thirst for love”: in form…, sound…, smell…, taste… (omitted), the material realm, the formless realm, the desire realm, the four constituents, the five endowments, past, future, now, the enlarged attachments in the dhammas that are seen, heard, felt, and knowable, are love. “In the world,” in the world of suffering, in the world of humans, (omitted)…, and in the world of being. “Able to cross the love in the world”: “The love in the world, he can pass through, surpass, pass, transcend, and overcome mindfully” [Ni.1].

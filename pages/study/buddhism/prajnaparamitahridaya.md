| And the same goes for sensation, perception, conditioning force and consciousness.                                                               | _vedana_, _samjna_, _sankhara_, _vijnana_                                                |
| Here, Sariputra, all dharmas have the mark of emptiness.                                                                                         | nbsp;                                                                                    |
| And this emptiness does not originate, is not extinguished, is not defiled, is not purified, does not decrease, does not increase.               | See [Appendix C.](#c-dharmas-are-marked-by-emptiness)                                    |
| Therefore, Sariputra,                                                                                                                            | &nbsp;                                                                                   |
| in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, no perception, no conditioning forces, no consciousness;                                            | _pañcaskandha_ (five aggregates: _rupa_, _vedana_, _samjna_, _sankhara_, _vijnana_)      |

| no shape, no sound, no scent, no taste, no feel, no mind-object;                                                                                 | _ṣaḍāyatana_ continued (six objects of consciousness)                                    |
| no eye-realm and so on up to no realm of mind consciousness;                                                                                     | six _dhatu_ (_caksur-dhatu_ ... _manovijnana-dhatu_)                                     |
| no ignorance, no extinction of ignorance and so on up to no old-age-and-death and no extinction of old-age-and-death.                            | _pratītyasamutpāda_ (twelve factors of dependent arising)                                |
| There is no suffering, no arising of suffering, no cessation of suffering, no path;                                                              | _catvaryāryasatyāni_ (four noble truths)                                                 |
| no knowledge, no attainment and no non-attainment.                                                                                               | _ijnana_, _prapti_                                                                       |
| &nbsp;                                                                                                                                           | Conclusion                                                                               |
| Therefore, Sariputra, because there is no attainment the bodhisattva dwells in reliance on the Perfection of Wisdom, without mental obstruction. | mental obstruction: _cittavarana_                                                        |
| Without mental obstruction they are without fear, they have passed beyond error, and their destination is nirvana.                               | their destination is nirvana: _nistha-nirvana_                                           |
| All the Buddhas of the three times have awakened to unexcelled perfect enlightenment by relying on the Perfection of Wisdom.                     | awakened : _abhisambuddha_, unexcelled perfect enlightenment : _anuttara-samyaksambodhi_ |
| Therefore the great mantra of the Perfection of Wisdom is to be known:                                                                           | &nbsp;                                                                                   |

## Appendix

Acronyms:
- PHS : Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra
- LPS : "Large Prajnaparamita Sutra". It is the _Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā sutra_ a.k.a. "The 25,000-Line Perfection 
of Wisdom Sutra".

### A. LPS version of the core section

According to Nattier's 1992 paper, the core part of the Heart Sutra _"from the first 'iha śāriputra' down to 'Na jñānam, na prāptir na-aprāptiḥ' was extracted from the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra or Perfection of Wisdom in 25,000 lines (see Conze's The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom, pg 61, section I 2.2c)_".

Here is the translation in english of the section Nattier is refering to, by Conze:

> Form is not one thing, and emptiness another;  
> emptiness is not one thing, and form another.  
> The very form is emptiness,  
> the very emptiness is form.  
> And so for feeling, etc.  
> And that emptiness, that is neither produced nor stopped, is neither defiled nor purified, does not decrease or increase;  
> and that which is neither produced nor stopped, neither defiled nor purified, neither decreased nor increased,  
> that is not past, future, or present.  
> There is no form in it, no feeling, etc.;  
> no eye, etc. to: no mind;  
> no form, etc, to: no mind-objects;  
> no eye-element, etc. to: no mind-consciousness-element;  
> no ignorance, no stopping of ignorance, etc. to : no decay and death, no stopping of decay and death;  
> no suffering and no comprehension of suffering; no origination and no forsaking of origination; no stopping and no realization of stopping; no path and no development of the path;  
> no attainment, and no reunion; no Streamwinner, and no fruit of a Streamwinner; etc. to: no Bodhisattva, and no knowledge of the modes of the path; no Buddha, and no enlightenment.

### B. Form is emptiness

In particular, here's sanskrit from the PHS with its usual english translation:

| English v1                           | PHS                       |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Form is empty;                       | rupam sunyam              |
| emptiness itself is form.            | sunyataiva rupam          |
| Form is not distinct from emptiness; | rupan na prthak sunyata   |
| emptiness is not distinct from form. | sunyataya na prthag rupam |

And the sanskrit from the LPS, with another translation (the one I'm choosing to use).

| LPS                      | English v2                                  |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| anyad rupam anya sunyata | Form is not one thing and emptiness another |
| nanya sunyatanyad rupam  | Emptiness is not one thing and form another |
| rupam eva sunyata        | Form itself is emptiness                    |
| sunyatva rupam           | Emptiness itself is form                    |

Note: the lines are ordered differently between the two versions.

### C. Dharmas are marked by emptiness

Regarding this passage starting with _"Here, Sariputra, all dharmas have the mark of emptiness."_,  Nattier notes:

> In this sequence the Large Sutra employs singular verbal forms throughout [...]. The Heart Sutra, by contrast, uses plural adjectival forms [...]. Not only are the terms themselves different in these two renditions; their grammatical forms (verbs vs. adjectives, singulars vs. plurals) do not agree. The wording thus could not be more different, though the overall meaning is the same.

I chose to use an LPS-based rendition of the text. Instead of "dharmas have the mark of emptiness, they (dharmas) are non-originated", using "dharmas have the mark of emptines; and this emptiness does not originate":

| English v1               | PHS        | LPS            | English v2              |
| :----------------------- | :--------- | :------------- | :---------------------- |
| They are non-originated, | anutpanna  | na utpaydyate  | [it] does not originate |

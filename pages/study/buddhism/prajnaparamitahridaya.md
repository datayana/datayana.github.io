Therefore, Sariputra, because there is no attainment the bodhisattva dwells in reliance on the Perfection of Wisdom, without mental obstruction 
_[cittavarana]_. Without mental obstruction they are without fear, they have passed beyond error, and their destination is nirvana _[nistha-nirvana]_. 

All the Buddhas of the three times have awakened _[abhisambuddha]_ to unexcelled perfect enlightenment _[anuttara-samyaksambodhi]_ by relying on the Perfection of Wisdom. Therefore the great mantra of the Perfection of Wisdom is to be known: the great spell (vidya) mantra, the supreme mantra, the mantra which is equal to the unequalled, the mantra which appeases all suffering.

| Because it is true, not false, |  _satyam amithyatvat_ |
| the mantra is spoken in the Perfection of Wisdom. | &nbsp; |

It goes: gate gateparagate parasamgate bodhi svaha.


## Appendix

Acronyms:
- PHS : Prajnaparamita Hridaya Sutra
- LPS : "Large Prajnaparamita Sutra". It is the _Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā prajñāpāramitā sutra_ a.k.a. "The 25,000-Line Perfection 
of Wisdom Sutra".

### LPS version of the core section

According to Nattier's 1992 paper, the core part of the Heart Sutra _"from the first 'iha śāriputra' down to 'Na jñānam, na prāptir na-aprāptiḥ' was extracted from the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra or Perfection of Wisdom in 25,000 lines (see Conze's The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom, pg 61, section I 2.2c)_".

Here is the translation in english of the section Nattier is refering to, by Conze:

> Form is not one thing, and emptiness another;  
> emptiness is not one thing, and form another.  
> The very form is emptiness,  
> the very emptiness is form.  
> And so for feeling, etc.  
> And that emptiness, that is neither produced nor stopped, is neither defiled nor purified, does not decrease or increase;  
> and that which is neither produced nor stopped, neither defiled nor purified, neither decreased nor increased,  
> that is not past, future, or present.  
> There is no form in it, no feeling, etc.;  
> no eye, etc. to: no mind;  
> no form, etc, to: no mind-objects;  
> no eye-element, etc. to: no mind-consciousness-element;  
> no ignorance, no stopping of ignorance, etc. to : no decay and death, no stopping of decay and death;  
> no suffering and no comprehension of suffering; no origination and no forsaking of origination; no stopping and no realization of stopping; no path and no development of the path;  
> no attainment, and no reunion; no Streamwinner, and no fruit of a Streamwinner; etc. to: no Bodhisattva, and no knowledge of the modes of the path; no Buddha, and no enlightenment.

#### Form is emptiness

In particular, here's sanskrit from the PHS with its usual english translation:

| English v1                           | PHS                        |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| Form is empty;                       | rupam sunyam              |
| emptiness itself is form.            | sunyataiva rupam          |
| Form is not distinct from emptiness; | rupan na prthak sunyata   |
| emptiness is not distinct from form. | sunyataya na prthag rupam |

And the sanskrit from the LPS, with another translation (the one I'm choosing to use).

| LPS                      | English v2                                  |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| anyad rupam anya sunyata | Form is not one thing and emptiness another |
| nanya sunyatanyad rupam  | Emptiness is not one thing and form another |
| rupam eva sunyata        | Form is emptiness                           |
| sunyatva rupam           | Emptiness itself is form                    |

Note: the lines are ordered differently between the two versions.

#### Dharmas are marked by emptiness

ALT: All dharmas are emptiness, without marks (tibetan)

| English v1               | PHS        | LPS            | English v2              |
| :----------------------- | :--------- | :------------- | :---------------------- |
| They are non-originated, | anutpanna  | na utpaydyate  | [it] does not originate |
| non-extinct,             | aniruddha  | na nirudhyate  | is not extinguished     |
| non-defiled,             | amala      | na samklisyate | is not defiled          |
| non-pure,                | avimala    | na vyavadayate | is not purified         |
| non-decreasing,          | anuna      | na hiyate      | does not decrease       |
| non-increasing.          | aparipurna | na vardhate    | does not increase.      |

## Nattier, 1992

An additional factor has been the understandable propensity of Buddhist specialists to approach the 
text either in its Sanskrit versions (with occasional reference to the 
recensions preserved in Chinese) or in its Chinese editions (with 
more or less adequate references to the corresponding passages in the 
Sanskrit). There have been, in other words, numerous intra-Sanskrit 
and intra-Chinese studies of the sutra> but no rigorously comparative - and cross-lingual - analysis of the text. 

The shorter Heart Sutra consists of three sections: (1) a brief 
introduction, in which the perspective of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara 
on the emptiness of the five skandhas (based on his practice of the 
Perfection of Wisdom) is introduced; (2) a core, in which 
Avalokitesvara (the implied speaker, though his name does not 
appear in this section) addresses a series of observations to the elder 
(sthavira) Sariputra, beginning with the well-known affirmation of 
the non-difference between form and emptiness and culminating in 
a series of negations countering virtually all the most basic categories 
of Buddhist analysis of the person, the nature of causality, and the 
path; and (3) a conclusion, in which the bodhisattva who relies on the 
Perfection of Wisdom is described, the Perfection of Wisdom is 
touted as the basis for the enlightenment of all buddhas, and the well
known mantra (gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha) is 
recommended as a means to eliminating all suffering. ThesiJfcra 
concludes with the mantra itself, which in all non-Sanskrit versions 
of the text is maintained in its Indian form (that is, it is transliterated 
rather than translated). 

particularities of the form:
- the sutra lacks a proper opening (that is, the requisite formula "Thus 
have I heard at one time. The Lord was staying at ...,"
- it lacks a proper conclusion (in which some reference to the reaction 
of the audience is generally made).
- the Buddha himself makes no appearance 
whatsoever in this sutra
- the main (and indeed only) speaker in this sutra is the bodhisattva 
Avalokitesvara, who generally plays no role at all in the Prajnaparamita 
literature.
- completely absent from the Heart Sutra is 
Subhuti, the main interlocutor in all of the earliest Prajnaparamita 
texts.
- the presence of a mantra at the conclusion of the text.

the central section (that is, all but 
the opening and closing lines) of the Heart Sutra matches a passage 
in the Large Sutra on the Perfection of Wisdom (Ch. Mo~ho po-jo 
po-lo-mi ching,* Skt. PancavimhtisaTiasrika-prajnapayamita-


, it is well 
known that Indian Mahayana texts were subject to continual elabo
ration and expansion, culminating (in the case of the Prajnaparamita 
literature) in such literary monstrosities as the Perfection of Wisdom 
in 100,(XX)Lines(§ata-sahashka-prajM-payaniita-sutra), whose con
siderable bulk is due mainly to its endless repetitions.

Heart Sutra was considered by Edward Conze, the foremost Western 
scholar of the Prajnaparamita literature, to be later, not earlier, than 
the Large Sutra, and to represent a condensation (not a prototype) of 
the larger text.27 And the evidence offered by the Chinese and Tibetan 
sources would seem to confirm Conze's hypothesis.

 While the Large 
Sutra had been translated into Chinese by the end of the 3rd century 
CE, the Heart Sutra makes its appearance much later, in the 5th 
century CE at the earliest and quite possibly not until the 7th.28 
Likewise the extant Indian commentaries on the Heart Sutra (which 
have not survived in their Sanskrit originals, but are preserved in 
Tibetan translation) date only from the 8th to the 11th centuries,29 
while commentaries on the Large Sutra appear several centuries 
earlier.30

### Research Problem

Our problem, therefore, is to 
come up with a sequence of literary evolution that could lead from 
the expansive text found in the Large Sutra to the concise formula
tions of the Heart Sutra.

s, we must not only 
posit the emergence of an abbreviated style from an elaborate one; 
we must also account for the substitution of adjectives for verbs, 
plurals for singulars, and synonyms (e.g., ksaya for nirodha) for 
certain Buddhist technical terms. 

If the evolution from a longer text to a shorter one is mildly 
(but not insuperably) problematic, these differences in vocabulary 
comprise an obstacle of an altogether different order. For such 
changes simply do not follow the normal rules of textual emendation.

The usual (and understandable) 
assumption has been that the path of transmission is from the Sanskrit 
Large Sutra to the Chinese Large Sutra, and from the Sanskrit Heart 
Sutra to the Chinese Heart Sutra. To approach the problem in this 
way, however, means that we would have to explain the identical 
appearance of the two Chinese texts via convergence: i.e., that they 
were either accidentally or deliberately brought into harmony. 

### Hypothesis

There is no difficulty, therefore, in positing a line of 
transmission from a version of the Sanskrit Large Sutra resembling 
the extant editions to the Chinese Large Sutra of Kumarajiva

The Chinese Heart Sutra, in other words, consists of an 
excerpt from the Chinese Large Sutra, together with certain "frame" 
elements (the opening and closing sections) that have no parallel in 
the larger text. 

So far, then, we have succeeded in establishing the sequence 
Sanskrit Large Sutra -> Chinese Large Sutra -* Chinese Heart Sutra, 
with no step of this process offering any difficulty. But how are we 
to fit the Sanskrit Heart Sutra into this scheme? The answer is as 
compelling as it is startling: the Sanskrit Heart Sutra is a translation 
from the Chinese. 

### Evidence (partial)

Here the sequence of negations is 
expressed in the Sanskrit Large Sutra in singular verbal forms, while 
in the Heart Sutra the entire list is given in the form of plural 
adjectives. [...] In each case the Chinese is a perfectly good rendition of the 
terminology contained in the Sanskrit Large Sutra, while the Sanskrit 
Heart Sutra in turn represents a perfecdy good rendition of the 
Chinese. Once again the Sanskrit Heart Sutra offers us exactly the 
kind of synonym-shift that we would expect if it were a back
translation from the Chinese. 

About the framing intro / avalokiteshvara
 (that is, in 
southwest China in the 7th century)? The answer, emphatically, is 
yes. The presence of Avalokitesvara is not at all unexpected, for this 
figure was by far the most popular bodhisattva in China at this time, 
as attested by both textual and artistic evidence.5

Yet the mantra does not occur 
here but in the frame section, which (if the reasoning outlined above 
is correct) should be viewed as a purely Chinese creation. How, then, 
are we to explain the presence of a perfectly good Sanskrit mantra in 
a text that was tailored in China? 

It would thus have been perfectly plausible 
that the composer of the original Chinese Heart Sutra adopted the 
mantra in question from an existing work and inserted it directly into 
his text.54 Moreover, not only the mantra itself, but also the string of 
epithets that precede it ("the supreme mantra, the mantra which is 
equal to the unequalled," etc.) have now been shown to occur 
independently in other Chinese texts.5

 If we treat the Chinese - rather than the Sanskrit - as the original, much can be clarified, for 
the language used here (particularly in the list of epithets of the 
mantra) includes Chinese terms for which no Sanskrit equivalent is 
readily apparent.

# Kesaputtiya Sutta (a.k.a. Kalama Sutta) - AN 3.65

This page presents an analysis and commentary on the Kesaputtiya Sutta, more widely known as the Kalama Sutta. This piece of scripture has often been used in texts introducing Buddhism under a modernist perspective. We'd like to deep dive into this text and relate it to popular interpretations of it.

On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of monks when he reached the town of the Kālāmas named Kesaputta. The Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard: “It is said that the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, has arrived at Kesaputta. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: ‘That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened … \[_as in 3:63_\] … and reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”

Then the Kālāmas of Kesaputta approached the Blessed One. Some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side … \[_as in 3:63_\] … some kept silent and sat down to one side. Sitting to one side, the Kālāmas said to the Blessed One:

“Bhante, there are some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesaputta. They explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others. But then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesaputta,
and they too explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others. We are perplexed and in doubt, Bhante, as to which of these good ascetics speak truth and which speak falsehood.”

“It is fitting for you to be perplexed, Kālāmas, fitting for you to be in doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter. Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence of a speaker, or because you think: ‘The ascetic is our guru.’ But when, Kālāmas, you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,’ then you should abandon them.

(1) “What do you think, Kālāmas? When greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?”

“For his harm, Bhante.”

“Kālāmas, a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life, takes what is not given, transgresses with another’s wife, and speaks falsehood; and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

(2) “What do you think, Kālāmas? When hatred arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?”

“For his harm, Bhante.”

“Kālāmas, a person who is full of hate, overcome by hatred, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life … and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

(3) “What do you think, Kālāmas? When delusion arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?”

“For his harm, Bhante.”

“Kālāmas, a person who is deluded, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life … and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“What do you think, Kālāmas? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?”—“Unwholesome, Bhante.”—“Blameworthy or blameless?”—“Blameworthy, Bhante.”—“Censured or praised by the wise?”—“Censured by the wise, Bhante.”—“Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to harm and suffering or not, or how do you take it?”—“Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to harm and suffering. So we take it.”

“Thus, Kālāmas, when we said: ‘Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition … But when you know for yourselves: “These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering,” then you should abandon them,’ it is because of this that this was said.

“Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence of a speaker, or because you think: ‘The ascetic is our guru.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to welfare and happiness,’ then you should live in accordance with them.

(1) “What do you think, Kālāmas? When non-greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?”

“For his welfare, Bhante.”

“Kālāmas, a person without greed, not overcome by greed, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life, take what is not given, transgress with another’s wife, or speak falsehood; nor does he encourage others to do likewise.
Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

(2) “What do you think, Kālāmas? When non-hatred arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?”

“For his welfare, Bhante.”

“Kālāmas, a person who is without hate, not overcome by hatred, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life … nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

(3) “What do you think, Kālāmas? When non-delusion arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?”

“For his welfare, Bhante.”

“Kālāmas, a person who is undeluded, not overcome by delusion, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life … nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?”

“Yes, Bhante.”

“What do you think, Kālāmas? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?”—“Wholesome, Bhante.”—“Blameworthy or blameless?”—“Blameless, Bhante.”—“Censured or praised by the wise?”—“Praised by the wise, Bhante.”—“Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to welfare and happiness or not, or how do you take it?”—“Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to welfare and happiness. So we take it.”

“Thus, Kālāmas, when we said: ‘Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition … But when you know for yourselves: “These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to welfare and happiness,” then you should
live in accordance with them,’ it is because of this that this was said.

“Then, Kālāmas, that noble disciple, who is thus devoid of longing, devoid of ill will, unconfused, clearly comprehending, ever mindful, dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness … with a mind imbued with compassion … with a mind imbued with altruistic joy … with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will.

“This noble disciple, Kālāmas, whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, has won four assurances in this very life.

“The first assurance he has won is this: ‘If there is another world, and if there is the fruit and result of good and bad deeds, it is possible that with the breakup of the body, after death, I will be reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.’

“The second assurance he has won is this: ‘If there is no other world, and there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds, still right here, in this very life, I maintain myself in happiness, without enmity and ill will, free of trouble.

“The third assurance he has won is this: ‘Suppose evil comes to one who does evil. Then, when I have no evil intentions toward anyone, how can suffering afflict me, since I do no evil deed?’

“The fourth assurance he has won is this: ‘Suppose evil does not come to one who does evil. Then right here I see myself purified in both respects.’

“This noble disciple, Kālāmas, whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, has won these four assurances in this very life.”

“So it is, Blessed One! So it is, Fortunate One! This noble disciple whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure,
has won four assurances in this very life.

“The first assurance he has won … as above, down to: … The fourth assurance he has won is this: ‘Suppose evil does not befall the evil-doer. Then right here I see myself purified in both respects.’

“This noble disciple, Bhante, whose mind is in this way without enmity, without ill will, undefiled, and pure, has won these four assurances in this very life.

“Excellent, Bhante! … We go for refuge to the Blessed One, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One consider us lay followers who from today have gone for refuge for life.”


## Textual patterns and matikas

There are three notable patterns in the text:
1. _"Do not go by..."_: 
2. _"When you know for yourselves..."_: 
3. The four assurances: 

The first two attract a lot of attention in secular reinterpretations of Buddhism. 


### A. "Do not go by..."

#### Anussava

- K. N. Jayatilleke, _Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge_, 1936 \[[ahandfulofleaves.org](http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Buddhist%20Theory%20of%20Knowledge_Jayatilleke.pdf)\], especially pp 182-188, 274-76

> We found three possible senses in which the word is used: (1) as used of the Vedic tradition 
the word could mean 'divine revelation', systematically handed down; (2) it could also have meant 'authoritative tradition' the source of its authority being not clearly perceived or defined—in this sense it could have meant any tradition including or other than the Vedic; (3) lastly, it could have meant a 'report' come from mouth to mouth(cp. J. Li58, which comments on the particle 'kira' used in statements conveying information received from 'hearsay', as anussavatthe nipäto, i.e. a particle in the sense of 'hearsay').  
> [...] We find \[_in M II 170 I_\] the Buddha asserting that a belief based on anussava can have the twofold result of turning out to be either true or false. Even if the assertion be from the most reliable revelation, tradition or report (anussava), there is no guarantee that it is true and it may very well be false. The right attitude to take is to suspend judgment regarding the truth of the assertion or proposition thus heard and say that 'I have heard p from anussava- but I do not claim to know p since p maybe false!' This is clearly a rejection of revelation, tradition or report as a pramäna or a valid means of knowledge.  
> K. N. Jayatilleke, _Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge_, 1936 \[[ahandfulofleaves.org](http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Buddhist%20Theory%20of%20Knowledge_Jayatilleke.pdf)\], pp. 182 and 184

$251: knowledge made ont en grounds in all are criticized as unsatisfactory

six first: claims of knowledge on the basis of some kind of authority

four last: claims to knowledge on the basis of some kind of reasoning or reflection.

"In agreement with the Buddha's contention that he does not belong to the class of teachers who are reasoners (takki) and speculatord (vimamsi), who base their knowledge on reasoning and speculation."

1. takka-hetu
2. naya-hetu

3. akara-parivitakkena

4 ditthi-nihjjana-kkhantiya

#### Logic [takka-hetu]

Opponents using reason?
- Takki (D I 16)
- Takkika (ud. 73)

"The commentary explains takka-hetu as 'takka-gahena'(AA. II.305), which may be translated by either 'by comprehending reasons' or 'by adhering to logic'.

"[Takka] does not make much sense however the word may be translated, unless we know who the takki and takkika were and what kind of takka they employed."

Nyaya Sutra (N.S. 1.2.1)
In the context of the Nikaya, "denote the reasoning that was employed to construct and defend metaphysical theories and perhaps meant the reasoning of sophists and dialecticians only in a secondary sense."

Three doctrines - everything appears to me true, everything appears to me untrue, some views appear to me true some false.
- "Those who firmly hold and dogmatically assert that any one of these theories is alone true and the others false"(M I 498) is likely to engage in contentious debate with their other two opponants, resulting in dispute, vexation and worry.
- "The Buddha speaks well of the second point of view as tending towards dispassion and lack of attachment, excitement, dogmatism and involvement [...] but the Buddha goes on to explain that holding the second view dogmatically and clinging to it is as bad as holding the other views."
- B. Bodhi, MN, note 734: "MA identifies the three views here as eternalism, annihilationism, and partial eternalism.", but note 713 "MA holds that Dighanakha is an annihilationist and explains [the 2nd assertion] to mean 'no mode of rebirth is acceptable to me', however the text itself does not give any concrete evidence supporting this interpretation."
- See MN 76.30 "eel-wrigglers" satire of the radical scepticism
- EBTOK $333: "Now, according to the commentary not only is Dighanakha said to be a materialist/annihilationist) but 'sabbam me na khamati' is interpreted differently. 'Sabbam' is said to be 'all rebirths and conceptions, which do not please him' (MA III 204)". <<< ??? not sure about EBTOK's translation of MA here >>>
- EBTOK $334: _"This commentarial identification of him as a Materialist is in fact confirmed by the text as well. In the course of the dialogue the Buddha tells Dighanakha that he should regard 'the body which has form,.is composed of the four primary elements and arises from father and mother (käyo rüpl cätummahäbhütiko mätapettika-sambhavo, M. I.500) as not a soul (anattato samanupassitabbo, loc. cit.J. The wording is unusual,2 occurs rarely and is identical with the phraseology used to describe the first school of the Materialists (viz. attä rüpl cätummahäbhütiko mätäpettikasambhavo, D. I.34). It appears as if the Buddha was making a specific criticism of the Materialist theory. There is therefore reason to think that Dighanakha was in fact a Materialist."_
- EBTOK #335: 1st view = Relativism: "The opposite of Dighanakha's view 'sabbam me khamati' (I agree with every view) is also said to be held by a school of recluses and brahmins (eke samanabrähmanä, loc. eh.). This point of view resembles, if it is not identical with the anekäntaväda of the Jains. According to this theory every view is true from some standpoint (naya) or other and in general3 no view can be categorically false. "
- EBTOK #335: _"The commentary is not helpful in identifying [the 1st view] since it makes no direct comment on it, but it seems indirectly to suggest or assume that 'Sabbam me khamati' is the eternalist view being the opposite of Dighanakha's Materialist position while 'ekaccam me khamati...' (I agree with some views) is said to be the semi-eternalist view. But this explanation is far-fetched and therefore inadmissible for had the compiler of this sutta been thinking of the eternalist or semi-eternalist views there is no reason why he should not have employed more direct and less ambiguous language and said 'sassatam (or sassata-ditthi) me khamati' instead of 'sabbam me khamati' and 'ekaccasassatam (or ekaccasassata-ditthi) me khamati' instead of 'ekaccam me khamati ekaccam me na khamati'."_
- EBTOK $340: "Another set of thinkers who appear prima facie to be vitandavädins are the recluses and brahmins, whom the third school of Sceptics (v. supra, 167) feared would engage them in debate. They were described as 'learned (panditä), subtle (nipunä), hairsplitters (välavedhirüpä), who have mastered the doctrines of others (kataparappavädä)3 and who go about shattering (vobhindantä) with their 
intelligence (pannägatena) the theories put forward (ditthigatäni)' (D. I. 26).", also see S V 73 Kundaliya, and M I 133 (TODO: look for vadapamokkha?)
- EBTOK #343: ref M I 133 and its commentary _"what is meant according to this explanation is that some people learn the Dhamma either for the mere sake of defending it against others' criticisms or for the sake of criticizing with its help the theories of others. And this is condemned, for the Dhamma according to this Sutta is to be regarded as a plan of action and not as a theory to be clung to and pitted against other theories in debate either for the purposes of defending it or criticizing with its aid opposing theories."
- EBTOK #347 ref A V 230: 
- hair-splitters (valavedhirupa), controversalists, M I 176, M II 122, M II 123, M I 396, S III 6, also referenced in D III 260, M I 72, A IV 307, asking dilemmas such as M I 392-393, S IV 323
- EBTOK #359: "From our investigations so far we found that with the possible exception of Sanjaya's school there was little evidence for the existence of sophists in the Greek sense of the term. It is however not unlikely that there were quite a few vitandavädins among the dialecticians (kataparappavädä .. . vobhindantä caranti) but as we have shown there is no reason to believe that the majority of them belonged to this class. There is no evidence in Pali literature that either of these two classes were called takki, although the word takka (tarka) was later employed in the Nyäyasütra to denote an indirect argument used to disprove one's opponent's thesis."

- EBTOK #365: viggahikakatham anuyutta = reclused and brahmins who are addicted to the debate (D I 8, M II 243, S III 11), introduced by the sentence katham viggayha katta hoti = how is one a contentious debater (S II 11).
- EBTOK #373: "reasons were being adduced in proof of the theories put forward by various proponents at this time and that the validity of this reasoning was being questioned by their opponents. There seems to have been, therefore, a conception of valid and invalid reasoning (cp. sutakkitam pi.. . duttakkitam pi hoti, M. L520) at this time. This reasoning is called takka (Sn. 885, 886) and as we have seen, it is said that 'people say the two things "true" and "false" by employing takka on views' (Sn. 886). What is probably meant is that in the process of debating people utilize reason to prove that certain theories are true and others false."
- EBTOK #373: "The problem is whether these theories were both constructed by takka- as well as defended by takka-. There is no doubt that all these theories that were debated were defended or criticized by takka, but it is doubtful whether all of them were also constructed by takka, although no doubt a good many of them probably were (y. infra, 435)"
_ EBTOK #374: "Of the sixty two theories mentioned in the Brahmajäla Sutta only four (D. 1.16, 21, 23, 29) are specifically associated with the takki and are said to be 'constructed by takka' takka-pariyähatam, loc. ciu As for the others it is implied that some (e.g. the three 'Eternalist' (sassataväda) and the three 'Semi-Eternalist' (ekacca-sassata-väda) theories (other than the two attributed to takka), are at least not wholly due to takka (v. infra, 416) but to jhänic perception, while it is not specified whether the others (e.g. the Materialist and Survivalist theories) are due to takka or not. 
- EBTOK #419: "the term takki is quite clearly used of a 'rationalist' in the sense of a 'pure reasoner' (suddha-takkika) who constructed a metaphysical theory on the basis of reasoning. In this sense takki and vimamsi (investigator, speculator) go together. There are four such theories mentioned in the Brahmajäla Sutta, as being the product of such rational speculation. We may examine them to see the kind of reasoning on which they are based.": -> D I 16
- EBTOK #435: "We are now in a position to see that the term takka- meant in the Päli Nikäyas either (i) the kind of reasoning with which the theories, which were debated at this time, were defended or criticized, even if they may not have been in origin products of reasoning at all, or (ii) the kind of reasoning with which the speculative, rational metaphysical theories were constructed and which the commentator has called 'pure reasoning'. We found that these latter appear to have been constructed on the basis of a priori reasoning, but the instances were too few and their identity too uncertain for us to be quite sure about this. So when it was enjoined that 'one should not accept (a theory) on the grounds of takka-' (mä takka-hetu, v. supra, 314), it meant that 'reasoning' of the type (i) or (ii) should not be considered as giving knowledge of the truth of these theories." + ref to Sandaka Sutta

- MN 74: A bhikkhu whose mind is liberated thus [...] sides with none and disputes with none; he employs the speech currently used in the world without adhering to it." -> MA then quotes SN 1:5/i.14), also see DN 9.53/i.202

Opposing schools:
- Ajita Kesakambali (D I 55), the materialist
- materialists in general (D I 34, 35)
- the soul is the same as the body (D I 160)
- the soul exists after death (D I 188)
- tathagato = soul ?? (DA I 118)

- tathagata exis
ts after death + 3 other alternatives (D I 27 + Ud 67)
- Makkhali Gosala denies "free will" (D I 53)
- Purana Kassapa denies "moral government" (D I 52)
- Casuistic: Saccaka boasts about his dialectical invicibility (M I 227, 237)
- moral sceptics (amaravikkhepika)
- Ajivakas, Ajita of the Hair-garment (???)
- "Sanjaya the sophist": was probably limited to the range of transcendent propositions

What schools are afraid of:
- feat or disgust at anuyoga (D I 26) ?
- afraid of falsehood (D I 25)
- vexation can result from debate (M I 499)

Distinction between 2 ways to hold views (EBTOK):
- dogmatically, "note giving it up as a view and the possibility of changing it for another" (M I 398)
- non-dogmatically and disinterestedly "giving it up as a view and with no possibility of changing it for another" (M I 398)

EBTOK $332: "That the Buddhist attitude to the sceptics (amaravikkhepika) was on the whole a favourable one is also apparent from the place they receive in the Sandaka Sutta (M I 520, 521), where the religion of these sceptics was classified as one of the four unsatisfactory but not totally false religions. It also tends to confirm our supposition that the sceptics, despite their intellectual scepticism had a conception of the moral and religious life."


a) professed controversialists, materialist or sceptical air

#### Inference [naya-hetu]

TBD

#### Ponderation [akara-parivitakka-hetu]

- EBTOK #438, citescommentary: 'thinking that this is a good reason after reflecting over reasons in this manner' (sundaram idam käranan ti evam kärana-parivitakkena, A A. II. 3 05)
- occurence in D I 138, D I 139 but different meaning
- EBTOK #439: occurence in M I 320, in the sense of "reason" : "what were the reasons (akara) or the grounds (anvaya) on which he says that 'the Exalted One is perfectly enlightened' [...] he should be in a position to reply that he has studies the dhamma and 'had come to realize by his own personal higher knowledge the truth of part of the dhamma and has come to the conclusion (on this basis) that 'the Exalted One was perfectly enlightened'".
- TODO: "how own personal higher knowledge" => "nana" ? check #666

### Reflection [ditthi-nijjhana-kkhanti]

- EBTOK #440 cites commentary 'because it agrees with our theory accepted after consideration and after being convinced of it' (amhäkam nijjhäyitvä khamitvä gahita-ditthiyä saddhim sameti, AA. II. 305).
- EBTOK #440 refs M I 133, nijjhänam khamati occurs as a single phrase to describe the conviction that dawns after thinking about a theory (or the dhamma) and 
intelligently examining its meaning.
- EBTOK #442: Pancattaya Sutta records sixteen theories, which are said to be accepted on subjective considerations, as well as the kind of rational reflexion. (M I 234)
- Canki Sutta M I 170

#### Notes

We're focusing here on this sentence:
> Etha tumhe, kālāmā, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭaka­sam­padā­nena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāra­pari­vitak­kena, mā diṭṭhi­nij­jhā­nak­khan­tiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā samaṇo no garūti.

We're looking in other texts for combinations of those three [lists/matikas](../docs/matikas.md):
- list 1: [anussavena], [paramparāya], [itikirāya], [piṭaka­sam­padā­nena]
- list 2: [takkahetu], [nayahetu], [ākāra­pari­vitak­kena], [diṭṭhi­nij­jhā­nak­khan­tiyā]
- list 3: [bhabbarūpatāya], [samaṇo no garūti]

_Note: Results extracted using [matika-finder](https://github.com/therabyte/matika-finder), occurences of only one single term have not been considered._

Findings:
- list 1 is included in a list of "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis", criticized in SN12.68, SN35.153, MN102, MN76, MN95: faith [saddhā], personal preference [ruci], oral tradition [anussavā], reasoned reflexion [ākāraparivitakkā], acceptance of a view after pondering itth [diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti]
- these expression are related to a larger argument around the access knowledge, how to claim knowledge.

Below is a visualization of co-occurences between those terms:

![visualization of co-occurences](img/matikaviz-10-acceptance-thesis.png)


### B. "When you know for yourselves..."

We're focusing here on this sentence:
> Yadā tumhe, kālāmā, attanāva jāneyyātha: ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṃvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, kālāmā, pajaheyyātha.

This pattern would be built around the expression "attanāva jāneyyātha". But the only occurences of this exact expression (see [query "attanāva jāneyyātha"](https://suttacentral.net/search?query=%22attan%C4%81va+j%C4%81neyy%C4%81tha%22&lang=)) are AN3.35, AN3.36, AN4.193 (see below).

Considering the suttas related to the first pattern, this could be another expression of the right way to access and claim knowledge of a view (as "personal knowledge" [paccattameva ñāṇa] from SN12.68, or "seeing with wisdom" [dhammā paññāya disvā veditabbā] the extinction of taints as in SN35.153).

This time the discourse is given by Venerable Nandaka to Salha and Rohana. Nandaka starts directly by saying to Salhla this paragraph seen in [AN3.65](https://suttacentral.net/pi/an3.65/) (_"Come, Salha, do not go by..."_).

Then Nandaka unfolds the same reasoning as in AN3.65: abandoning practices and views rooted in greed [lobha], aversion [dosa] and delusion [moha], and that lead to suffering.

This time, greed [lobha] is said to mean "longing" [abhijjhā], and that longing leads to wrong deeds. Aversion [dosa] is said to mean "ill will" [byāpāda], idem. And delusion [moha] is said to mean "ignorance" [avijjā].

In this sutta, Nandaka doesn't mention the four assurances. Instead, he says that the noble disciple, as a reward of abandoning greed, aversion, delusion, understands thus: _"There is this; there is the inferior; there is the superior; there is a further escape from whatever is involved with perception."_ And he is liberated from taints.
note 462 ref to [MN7.17](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn7/) four divine abodes?

[B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, note 462 p 1654] adds that the commentary (Anguttara Nikaya-atthakatha) establishes a relation between these four and the four noble truths:
- "there is this": five aggregates, truth of suffering
- "inferior": truth of the origin of suffering
- "superior": truth of the path
- "further escape": nibbana, truth of cessation

In this sutta, Baddhiya comes to the Buddha because he heard that _"the ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects"_ ([B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, p567], see also note 907 ref to [SN42.13](https://suttacentral.net/pi/sn42.13) and [MN56.8](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn56)). The Buddha dispells how "some ascetics and brahmins untruthfully, baselessly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresent [him]" by saying this. He uses the same sutta as in AN 3.65 to show what his conversion is about: abandoning practices and views rooted in greed [lobha], aversion [dosa] and delusion [moha], and that lead to suffering (with vehemence [sārambha] added in the mix).

This time the Buddha doesn't mention the four assurances. But he asks Baddhiya: _"did I say to you: 'Come, Bhaddiya, be my disciple and I will be your teacher'?"_. Bhaddiya says no. The emphasis seems to be on the choice Bhaddiya made to go to the Buddha for refuge on his own.

After having said how beneficial it would be for basically everyone to convert that way (in note 911, B. Bodhi refers to MN56.26 at this point), at the very end of the sutta, there is this interesting paragraph:
> "If these great sal trees would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to the welfare and happiness even of these great sal trees for a long time, if they could choose. How much more then for a human being!" [B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, p 570]

_Note: B. Bodhi note 912 mentions that "sace ceteyyum" ("if they could choose") is found in Sinhala-script and Roman-script but not Burmese-script._

This sutta reports an exchange happening between the four Venerables Musila, Savittha, Narada and Ananda.

Savittha asks Musila the following question:

> Friend Musila, apart from faith, apart from personal preference, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned reflexion, apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it, does the Venerable Musila have personal knowledge thus: 'With birth as condition, aging-and-death [comes to be]?' [B. Bodhi, SN, p. 612]

This unfolds along the list of factors of dependent origination. And the final point is Savittha saying "I know this, I see this: 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence'". To that sentence, Musila concludes that Savittha is an Arahant.

But Narada interrupts. And an exchange of the same kind unfolds into a discussion on the point that it is not enough to know and see 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence' to be an arahant. That one needs also to extinguish all taints related to this view, to make "bodily contact" with this truth (use of a simile).

In his notes, B.Bodhi points to a discussion on the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis" [B. Bodhi, SN, note 198, p 781] which are here put in comparison with "Personal knowledge" [paccattameva ñāṇa], and are also criticized in SN35.153 (see below):
- faith [saddhā]
- personal preference [ruci]
- oral tradition [anussavā]
- reasoned reflexion [ākāraparivitakkā]
- acceptance of a view after pondering itth [diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti]

Pointed out in [B. Bodhi, SN, note 198, p 781] as another sutta criticizing the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis".

In this sutta, the investigation related to **how a Bhikkhu can declare** [] - 'Detroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being'.

The answer the Buddha provides is related to one, having seen a form, a sound with the ear... a mental phenomenon with the mind, "sees with wisdom" [dhammā paññāya disvā veditabbā] that there is no lust, hatred or delusion [lobha, dosa, moha] internally.

> Therein, bhikkhus, as to those reclues and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: 'The self and the world are eternal: only this is true, anything else is wrong,' that apart from faith, apart from approval, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned cogitation, apart from reflective acceptance of a view, they will have any pure and clear personal knowledge of this - that is impossible. Since they have no pure and clear personal knowledge, even the mere fragmentary knowledge that those good recluses and brahmins clarify [about their view] is declared to be clinging on their part. [B. Bodhi, MN, p 843]

Basing acceptance of a thesis on the five grounds (faith, personal preference, oral tradition, reasoned reflexion, acceptance of a view after pondering it) would be considered as clinging to a wrong view.

# Kesaputtiya Sutta (a.k.a. Kalama Sutta) - AN 3.65

This page presents an analysis and commentary on the Kesaputtiya Sutta, more widely known as the Kalama Sutta. This piece of scripture has often been used in texts introducing Buddhism under a modernist perspective. We'd like to deep dive into this text and relate it to popular interpretations of it.

## The text of the Sutta itself

- English: **Aṅguttara Nikāya / The Book of the Threes / 65. Kesaputtiya** [suttacentral.net/en/an3.65](https://suttacentral.net/en/an3.65)
- Pali: **Aṅguttara Nikāya 3 / 7. Mahāvagga / 65. Kesamuttisutta** [suttacentral.net/pi/an3.65](https://suttacentral.net/pi/an3.65)

## How is the Kalama Sutta spoken about?

In this section, we examine some references to the Sutta by Buddhists authors or scholars. **Highlights** are from us.

### Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 1994

Thanissaro Bhikkhu, "Kalama Sutta: To the Kalamas", 1994 \[[accesstoinsight.org](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html)\]

_Although this discourse is often cited as the Buddha's carte blanche for following one's own sense of right and wrong, it actually says something much more rigorous than that. **Traditions are not to be followed simply because they are traditions**. Reports (such as historical accounts or news) are not to be followed simply because the source seems reliable. One's own preferences are not to be followed simply because they seem logical or resonate with one's feelings. Instead, **any view or belief must be tested** by the results it yields when put into practice; and — to guard against the possibility of any bias or limitations in one's understanding of those results — they **must further be checked against the experience of people who are wise**._

### Soma Thera, 1994

Soma Thera, "Kalama Sutta - The Buddha's Charter of Free Inquiry", 1994, \[[accesstoinsight.org](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html)\]

_The instruction of the Kalamas (Kalama Sutta) is justly famous for its **encouragement of free inquiry**; the spirit of the sutta signifies a **teaching that is exempt from fanaticism, bigotry, dogmatism, and intolerance**._  
_[...] Here it may be mentioned that the methods of examination in the Kalama Sutta and in the extracts cited here, have sprung from the knowledge of things as they are and that the tenor of these methods are implied in all straight thinking. Further, as penetration and comprehension, the constituents of wisdom are the result of such thinking, the place of **critical examination and analysis** in the development of right vision is obvious._  
_[...] More than fifty years ago, Moncure D. Conway, the author of "My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East," visited Colombo. He was a friend of Ponnambalam Ramanathan (then Solicitor General of Ceylon), and together with him Conway went to the Vidyodaya Pirivena to learn something of the Buddha's teaching from Hikkaduve Siri Sumangala Nayaka Thera, the founder of the institution. The Nayaka Thera explained to them the principles contained in the Kalama Sutta and at the end of the conversation Ramanathan whispered to Conway: "Is it not strange that you and I, who come from far different religions and regions, should together listen to **a sermon from the Buddha in favor of that free thought**, that independence of traditional and fashionable doctrines, which is still the vital principle of human development?" — Conway: "Yes, and we with the (Kalama) princes pronounce his doctrines good."_

### Bhikkhu Bodhi, 1998

Bhikkhu Bodhi, "A Look at the Kalama Sutta", 1998, \[[accesstoinsight.org](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_09.html)\]

> **On the basis of a single passage, quoted out of context, the Buddha has been made out to be a pragmatic empiricist who dismisses all doctrine and faith**, and whose Dhamma is simply a freethinker's kit to truth which invites each one to accept and reject whatever he likes.
> [...] Now this passage, like everything else spoken by the Buddha, has been stated in a specific context — with a particular audience and situation in view — and thus must be understood in relation to that context.
> [...] From the subsequent development of the sutta, it is clear that **the issues that perplexed [the Kalamas] were the reality of rebirth and kammic retribution** for good and evil deeds.
> [...] He next speaks the passage quoted above, advising the Kalamas to abandon those things they know for themselves to be bad and to undertake those things they know for themselves to be good. This advice can be dangerous if given to those whose ethical sense is undeveloped, and we can thus assume that the Buddha regarded the Kalamas as people of refined moral sensitivity.
> [...] the Kalamas, at the start of the discourse, were not the Buddha's disciples. They approached him merely as a counselor who might help dispel their doubts [...] Because the Kalamas had not yet come to accept the Buddha in terms of his unique mission, as the discloser of the liberating truth, it would not have been in place for him to expound to them the Dhamma unique to his own Dispensation: such teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the three characteristics, and the methods of contemplation based upon them.
> [...] Thus the discourse to the Kalamas offers an acid test for gaining confidence in the Dhamma as a viable doctrine of deliverance. We begin with an immediately verifiable teaching whose validity can be attested by anyone with the moral integrity to follow it through to its conclusions, namely, that the defilements cause harm and suffering both personal and social, that their removal brings peace and happiness, and that the practices taught by the Buddha are effective means for achieving their removal. By putting this teaching to a personal test, with only a provisional trust in the Buddha as one's collateral, one eventually arrives at a firmer, experientially grounded confidence in the liberating and purifying power of the Dhamma. This increased confidence in the teaching brings along a deepened faith in the Buddha as teacher, and thus disposes one to accept on trust those principles he enunciates that are relevant to the quest for awakening, even when they lie beyond one's own capacity for verification. This, in fact, marks the acquisition of right view, in its preliminary role as the forerunner of the entire Noble Eightfold Path.
> [...] Partly in reaction to dogmatic religion, partly in subservience to the reigning paradigm of objective scientific knowledge, it has become fashionable to hold, by appeal to the Kalama Sutta, that the Buddha's teaching dispenses with faith and formulated doctrine and asks us to accept only what we can personally verify. This interpretation of the sutta, however, forgets that the advice the Buddha gave the Kalamas was contingent upon the understanding that they were not yet prepared to place faith in him and his doctrine; it also forgets that the sutta omits, for that very reason, all mention of right view and of the entire perspective that opens up when right view is acquired. It offers instead the most reasonable counsel on wholesome living possible when the issue of ultimate beliefs has been put into brackets.
> [...] What can be justly maintained is that those aspects of the Buddha's teaching that come within the purview of our ordinary experience can be personally confirmed within experience, and that this confirmation provides a sound basis for placing faith in those aspects of the teaching that necessarily transcend ordinary experience. Faith in the Buddha's teaching is never regarded as an end in itself nor as a sufficient guarantee of liberation, but only as the starting point for an evolving process of inner transformation that comes to fulfillment in personal insight.

### Rosenberg, 2006

Larry Rosenberg, "The Right to Ask Questions", 2006, \[[accesstoinsight.org](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/rosenberg/righttoask.html)\], in "Three steps to awakening : a practice for bringing mindfulness to life" \[[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/threestepstoawak0000rose/page/n9/mode/2up?q=%22kalama+sutta%22)\]

_Of all the teachings of the Buddha, the Kalama Sutta is one of my favorites precisely because it **encourages such rigorous inquiry into our beliefs**. Indeed, if Buddhism were not infused with the spirit of this sutta — **a spirit of questioning, of critical examination** — I'm quite sure I would not have a meditative practice today._  
_[...] The Kalamas of the Kalama Sutta were, like my father, a **skeptical but responsible** bunch. They were quite alive to spiritual matters, but they were overrun with teachers and teachings, each teacher competing for an audience, each propounding a different philosophy or path. Their situation was not very different from ours now._  
_In the Kalama Sutta, **the Buddha is not saying that ancient teachings are irrelevant, or that you have to reinvent the dharma wheel** every time you think. He's not saying not to accept the guidance of teachers or not to read the scriptures. After all, how else are you going to find out what's criticized and praised by the wise? No, what he's saying is: Don't give final authority to these teachings. Don't give final authority to your own ideas. **You have to test the teachings, and your ideas, in the laboratory of your actions**._  
_So what is the test of truth? The Buddha offers a simple formula: **Test things in terms of cause and effect. Whatever is unskillful, leading to harm and ill, should be abandoned; whatever is skillful, leading to happiness and peace, should be pursued**. Apply the test of skillfulness to all teachings in all your actions._

### Dipen Barua, 2021

Dipen Barua, "The Kalama Sutta: The First Rationalist Buddhist Text?", 2021, \[[buddhistdoor.net](https://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/the-kalama-sutta-the-first-rationalist-buddhist-text/)\]

> To this day, it is interpreted as a pro-skeptic, pro-rationalist text. In this sutta is a famous passage in which the Buddha argues for a rigorous questioning of religious teachings. Because of this celebrated passage, **the text as a whole has been interpreted as advocating the rejection of anything that contradicts rational thought or empirical understanding, even the Buddhist teachings**. Or, reframed, anything that is unseen and that cannot be empirically verified is incompatible with the Buddha’s free thinking. Therefore, teachings of the afterlife or karma are superstitious baggage that go against the “original spirit” of the Buddha’s inquiring mind.
> Here, I hope to provide a more rigorous exegesis of the Kalama Sutta, and respond to the rationalist claim that the Kalama Sutta advocates a skeptical approach to all things: it qualitatively does not, and, **in fact, the text argues precisely that a free and open mind will lead one to acceptance of the Buddhadhamma**.

> The Kalamas were themselves not skeptics because they lacked the knowledge to determine the veracity of a teaching. Rather, they were beset by uncertainty and confusion after encountering diverse and contradictory teachings from various gurus, brahmins, and yogis.

> **The rationalist interpretation cherry picks from the first half of the Kalama Sutta**, leaving the Kalamas narratively suspended in uncertainty and confusion. However, in the second half of the text, the Buddha provides assurance of the truth, the Dhamma. The Buddha’s unveiling to the Kalamas of the Noble Eightfold Path is the conclusion of the sutta. In a correct exegesis, **the Buddha’s 10 points of skepticism are aimed directly at those who doubt his teaching**. This is quite a different conclusion to the pro-agnostic, pro-skeptical position advocated by rationalists.

> The rationalist paradigm has dominated academic and broader globalized discourse for decades. Even the Buddhist tradition, particularly in the West after World War Two, partially conceded epistemic understanding to the scientific, empiricist worldview. **Both Buddhists and rationalists have cited the Kalama Sutta as legitimizing the rationalist paradigm as an authentically Buddhist position**. However, they only refer to the initial portion of the sutta, in which the Buddha states his 10 points of skepticism, while ignoring the rest. Rationalist advocates further argue that in this text, the Buddha did not say anything about an afterlife, and therefore the afterlife, at worst, does not exist, and at best, is a later superstitious accretion that can be dismissed as not belonging to “original Buddhism.”

> We now know that this understanding of early Buddhism is itself **a bias shaped by scientism and Protestant-inspired prejudices** that date back to early clashes between what early European and American Buddhologists saw as “Buddhist superstition” versus “true Buddhism.” The Buddha, in fact, spoke extensively not only on the subject of the afterlife, but also on rebirth, kamma, and a transcendent, unseen reality. Empiricism is only one aspect of the story—not the whole.

### Bloom, XXXX

Alfred Bloom, "Critical Thinking in Buddhism: The Kalama Sutta", XXXX, \[[bschawaii.org](https://bschawaii.org/shindharmanet/critical/)\]

> Here Gotama Buddha gives advice on how seekers should respond when they are confronted by diversity of views concerning the path to enlightenment and spiritual fulfillment, even Gotama’s. He **advocates a questioning, inquiring spirit**, **refusing to accept anything simply based on invoking an authority**.

> We are not to simply accept a surmise, something accepted as true while as yet unproven. We make surmises frequently, concluding that something is true, though we may not have all the facts or information. Such conclusions are easily shaped by prejudices and are to be questioned, even when recognized authorities assert them.
> We are **not to accept something because it is an axiom, axiomatic, that is, an unquestioned, apparently self evident, or assumed truth**. To question an axiom seems to go against reason, but may be the highest reason. Many things once accepted in society as axioms, givens, such as the separation of races, male superiority, that the earth is flat, etc. have given way to questioning, **resulting in the progress of society and culture**.
> Specious reasoning asserts ideas which are plausible, seemingly correct or logical but with investigation are found to be erroneous or false. They can be what we regard as half truths. Political campaigns and religious debate often employ such assertions.

> As the Buddha charged his disciples at his death to be a refuge to themselves, a light for themselves, so here also the **responsibility for determining the truth of your life is within yourself**.

### Dharmapala, 1892

Anagarika Dharmapala, _Life and Teachings of the Buddha_, 1892, \[[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.217594)\]]

> Buddhism may be called the **Religion of Analysis**. It analyses every phase of cosmic phenomenon, the constituents that go to make up a human being, and the differentiating states of mentality; it categorizes the differentiation of Good, Evil and Neutral; it **rejects every phase of superstitious belief** that is based on mere tradition, speculation, revelations, magic, analogy, logic, authority, and collected discourses, and **appeals to the purified heart** to distinguish the good from the bad, and to avoid doing anything that is correlated with covetousness, anger and lust. All that is pure and free from covetousness, anger and lust are productive of good, and therefore to be acted upon. Such was the doctrine that the Blessed One enunciated to the chiefs of the Kalama country which is elucidated in detail in the Kalama sutta of the Anguttara Nikaya.

### Gombrich, 1996

Richard F. Gombrich, "How Buddhism Began", 1996, \[[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/howbuddhismbegan0000gomb_m0m1/page/28/mode/2up?q=kalama)\], p. 28

> There can be no doubt that the Buddha’s emphasis was on experience: the experience he had had himself and the experience he wanted others to have too. While he often appeals to reason, in the sense that he uses rational argument, **the appeal to experience is even more important**.
> Modern rationalist expositors like to draw attention to the Kalama Sutta (AN III, 65, AN I, 188–193), in which the Buddha advises the Kalama clan not to accept any teaching merely on a teacher’s authority, but to work things out for themselves. 
> However, he also proceeds to preach to them **by asking them at each step whether they agree; he is appealing to their experience** – we might also call it their common sense.
> Moreover, the content of the sermon is to show that morality has practical advantages. Again, **the text is pragmatic and anti-theoretical**.

TODO: "It is only in poetry, in the last two books of the
Sutta-nipata, that the Buddha takes quietism to the point of claiming that he, or (more impersonally) the true sage, has no views (e.g. verses 787, 800, 882); and indeed it is to these poems that L.O. Gomez is referring in his article ‘Proto-Madhyamika in the Pali Canon’ (Gomez, 1976).""

> In Kalama Sutta, the Buddha places the onus of decision fairly and squarely on the individual. But, what is remarkable about the "Kalama Declaration" of the Buddha is that in its second phase he **sets up principles for the proper exercise of this individual responsibility**.

### Winston, 2003

> Only believe something you have clearly seen for yourself to be true. If after **fully examining, experiencing, and carefully considering a teaching** or some advice, and you find that it leads to happiness for one and all, accept it and live up to it.

> [Under a section "Is Buddhism Scientific?"] It can be seen from the Kalama Sutta that **the Buddha calls for free and total investigation**. It is no exxageration if we say that Buddhism about 2500 years ago had the best ideas, thoughts, techniques and methods for the development of the modern organizations and solutions for the managerial problems and conflicts.  
> In Kalama Sutta, the Buddha emphatically says : that “Do not believe in anything (simply) because you have heard it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do not believe in anything (simply) because it is found and written in your religious books. But after observation and analysis, when you **find that anything agrees with reason and conducive to the good** and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it. Management also a systemized body of knowledge is aimed at transforming the inputs into outputs through positive behaviour, adopting systems and standards. The management process of planning, organizing, staffing, co-ordinating is a systematic design to achieve the goals of the organizations.

> Then the Buddha gave them this advice, **unique in the history of religions**: "'Yes , Kalamas, it is proper that you have doubt, that you have perplexity, for a doubt has arisen in a matter which is doubtful. [...]"
> The Buddha went even further. He told the bhikkhus that **a disciple should examine even the Tathagata (Buddha) himself**, so that he (the disciple) might be fully convinced of the true value of the teacher whom he followed.

> Here is the Sutta to the Kalamas, the skeptics of the time of the Buddha. It shows that it is possible to follow this Way without any prior, simply by "seeing" the phenonemons as they are.
> The Dharma of the Buddha is not a religion, it is not a philosophy, except if one equals Prajñā et Sophia - they have in common some aspects, but cannot be taken for one another.

Dipobhasdhamma, "Is Buddhism a Religion? Why it Matters?", 2022, \[[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/is-buddhism-religion-updated/page/n7/mode/2up)\]

> When this presumed association between religion and Buddhism is scrutinized, it is not difficult to see that most of what constitutes the foundation of these arguments involves hair-splitting; selectively picking apart the teachings of the Buddha in order to find anything that is closest-to or similar-to the doctrines of the World’s religions. However, searching through the entire corpus of the Buddha’s teachings, it is difficult, to say the least, to find anything close to or similar to this worldview

>  “When you know for yourselves…” meaning that each individual can only verify the veracity of his teachings based on one’s own direct personal experience by application of his teachings. 

So, with regard to the part of the claim that “despite” the Buddha’s suggestion; that one not accept any assumed or forgone conclusion based on various sources, takes the entire corpus of the Buddha’s teachings completely out of context.
Once again, we have a gross generalization, which assumes the theistic requirement of faith is also true of Buddhism. Regarding the Buddha’s words, in that one should not accept his teachings based on blind faith, is not an example of the Buddha requiring faith. In this regard, the Buddha’s words to the Kalamas people is apropos:
This claim cannot be verified, wholly due to the fact that the Buddha clearly stated: “When you know for yourselves...” meaning that each individual can only verify the veracity of his teachings based on one’s own direct personal experience by application of his teachings.
The Buddha is saying that the proof of his statements is completely experiential, which to note: precedes the development of confidence, not the other way around, as it is written in Christian Bibles at Hebrews 11:1, which asks disciples, and adherents to have blind faith in something that is never seen, but can only be hoped for. This would be like someone simply reading the Eightfold Noble Path and believing that by reading it they gain hope that the teaching would somehow osmose into them, thus saving themselves from their own actions, which creates their own suffering.
This principle is altogether opposite of the tenets, dogma and doctrine of every theist-based religion, which infers that words or statements issued from a “god” or “gods,” and delivered via prophets, requires faith in that the words or statements of such gods are true; without a shred of empirical proof as to whether the doctrines, edicts, commandments or philosophy is sound and actually works. Since there are no means by which a follower of a theistic-based religion can prove even the existence of a god or gods, then the premise that whatever a god states is true, is
invalid.

Thanissaro Bhikkhu
The ability to question and test one's beliefs in an appropriate way is called appropriate attention. The ability to recognize and choose wise people as mentors is called having admirable friends. According to Iti 16-17, these are, respectively, the most important internal and external factors for attaining the goal of the practice. For further thoughts on how to test a belief in practice, see MN 61, MN 95, AN 7.79, and AN 8.53. For thoughts on how to judge whether another person is wise, see MN 110, AN 4.192, and AN 8.54.

## Textual patterns and matikas

There are three notable patterns in the text:
1. _"Do not go by..."_: 
2. _"When you know for yourselves..."_: 
3. The four assurances: 

The first two attract a lot of attention in secular reinterpretations of Buddhism. 


### A. "Do not go by..."

#### Anussava

- K. N. Jayatilleke, _Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge_, 1936 \[[ahandfulofleaves.org](http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Buddhist%20Theory%20of%20Knowledge_Jayatilleke.pdf)\], especially pp 182-188, 274-76

> We found three possible senses in which the word is used: (1) as used of the Vedic tradition 
the word could mean 'divine revelation', systematically handed down; (2) it could also have meant 'authoritative tradition' the source of its authority being not clearly perceived or defined—in this sense it could have meant any tradition including or other than the Vedic; (3) lastly, it could have meant a 'report' come from mouth to mouth(cp. J. Li58, which comments on the particle 'kira' used in statements conveying information received from 'hearsay', as anussavatthe nipäto, i.e. a particle in the sense of 'hearsay').  
> [...] We find \[_in M II 170 I_\] the Buddha asserting that a belief based on anussava can have the twofold result of turning out to be either true or false. Even if the assertion be from the most reliable revelation, tradition or report (anussava), there is no guarantee that it is true and it may very well be false. The right attitude to take is to suspend judgment regarding the truth of the assertion or proposition thus heard and say that 'I have heard p from anussava- but I do not claim to know p since p maybe false!' This is clearly a rejection of revelation, tradition or report as a pramäna or a valid means of knowledge.

$251: knowledge made ont en grounds in all are criticized as unsatisfactory

six first: claims of knowledge on the basis of some kind of authority

four last: claims to knowledge on the basis of some kind of reasoning or reflection.

"In agreement with the Buddha's contention that he does not belong to the class of teachers who are reasoners (takki) and speculatord (vimamsi), who base their knowledge on reasoning and speculation."

1. takka-hetu
2. naya-hetu

3. akara-parivitakkena

4 ditthi-nihjjana-kkhantiya

#### Logic [takka-hetu]

Opponents using reason?
- Takki (D I 16)
- Takkika (ud. 73)

"The commentary explains takka-hetu as 'takka-gahena'(AA. II.305), which may be translated by either 'by comprehending reasons' or 'by adhering to logic'.

"[Takka] does not make much sense however the word may be translated, unless we know who the takki and takkika were and what kind of takka they employed."

Nyaya Sutra (N.S. 1.2.1)
In the context of the Nikaya, "denote the reasoning that was employed to construct and defend metaphysical theories and perhaps meant the reasoning of sophists and dialecticians only in a secondary sense."

Three doctrines - everything appears to me true, everything appears to me untrue, some views appear to me true some false.
- "Those who firmly hold and dogmatically assert that any one of these theories is alone true and the others false"(M I 498) is likely to engage in contentious debate with their other two opponants, resulting in dispute, vexation and worry.
- "The Buddha speaks well of the second point of view as tending towards dispassion and lack of attachment, excitement, dogmatism and involvement [...] but the Buddha goes on to explain that holding the second view dogmatically and clinging to it is as bad as holding the other views."
- B. Bodhi, MN, note 734: "MA identifies the three views here as eternalism, annihilationism, and partial eternalism.", but note 713 "MA holds that Dighanakha is an annihilationist and explains [the 2nd assertion] to mean 'no mode of rebirth is acceptable to me', however the text itself does not give any concrete evidence supporting this interpretation."
- See MN 76.30 "eel-wrigglers" satire of the radical scepticism
- EBTOK $333: "Now, according to the commentary not only is Dighanakha said to be a materialist/annihilationist) but 'sabbam me na khamati' is interpreted differently. 'Sabbam' is said to be 'all rebirths and conceptions, which do not please him' (MA III 204)". <<< ??? not sure about EBTOK's translation of MA here >>>
- EBTOK $334: _"This commentarial identification of him as a Materialist is in fact confirmed by the text as well. In the course of the dialogue the Buddha tells Dighanakha that he should regard 'the body which has form,.is composed of the four primary elements and arises from father and mother (käyo rüpl cätummahäbhütiko mätapettika-sambhavo, M. I.500) as not a soul (anattato samanupassitabbo, loc. cit.J. The wording is unusual,2 occurs rarely and is identical with the phraseology used to describe the first school of the Materialists (viz. attä rüpl cätummahäbhütiko mätäpettikasambhavo, D. I.34). It appears as if the Buddha was making a specific criticism of the Materialist theory. There is therefore reason to think that Dighanakha was in fact a Materialist."_
- EBTOK #335: 1st view = Relativism: "The opposite of Dighanakha's view 'sabbam me khamati' (I agree with every view) is also said to be held by a school of recluses and brahmins (eke samanabrähmanä, loc. eh.). This point of view resembles, if it is not identical with the anekäntaväda of the Jains. According to this theory every view is true from some standpoint (naya) or other and in general3 no view can be categorically false. "
- EBTOK #335: _"The commentary is not helpful in identifying [the 1st view] since it makes no direct comment on it, but it seems indirectly to suggest or assume that 'Sabbam me khamati' is the eternalist view being the opposite of Dighanakha's Materialist position while 'ekaccam me khamati...' (I agree with some views) is said to be the semi-eternalist view. But this explanation is far-fetched and therefore inadmissible for had the compiler of this sutta been thinking of the eternalist or semi-eternalist views there is no reason why he should not have employed more direct and less ambiguous language and said 'sassatam (or sassata-ditthi) me khamati' instead of 'sabbam me khamati' and 'ekaccasassatam (or ekaccasassata-ditthi) me khamati' instead of 'ekaccam me khamati ekaccam me na khamati'."_
- EBTOK $340: "Another set of thinkers who appear prima facie to be vitandavädins are the recluses and brahmins, whom the third school of Sceptics (v. supra, 167) feared would engage them in debate. They were described as 'learned (panditä), subtle (nipunä), hairsplitters (välavedhirüpä), who have mastered the doctrines of others (kataparappavädä)3 and who go about shattering (vobhindantä) with their 
intelligence (pannägatena) the theories put forward (ditthigatäni)' (D. I. 26).", also see S V 73 Kundaliya, and M I 133 (TODO: look for vadapamokkha?)
- EBTOK #343: ref M I 133 and its commentary _"what is meant according to this explanation is that some people learn the Dhamma either for the mere sake of defending it against others' criticisms or for the sake of criticizing with its help the theories of others. And this is condemned, for the Dhamma according to this Sutta is to be regarded as a plan of action and not as a theory to be clung to and pitted against other theories in debate either for the purposes of defending it or criticizing with its aid opposing theories."
- EBTOK #347 ref A V 230: 
- hair-splitters (valavedhirupa), controversalists, M I 176, M II 122, M II 123, M I 396, S III 6, also referenced in D III 260, M I 72, A IV 307, asking dilemmas such as M I 392-393, S IV 323
- EBTOK #359: "From our investigations so far we found that with the possible exception of Sanjaya's school there was little evidence for the existence of sophists in the Greek sense of the term. It is however not unlikely that there were quite a few vitandavädins among the dialecticians (kataparappavädä .. . vobhindantä caranti) but as we have shown there is no reason to believe that the majority of them belonged to this class. There is no evidence in Pali literature that either of these two classes were called takki, although the word takka (tarka) was later employed in the Nyäyasütra to denote an indirect argument used to disprove one's opponent's thesis."

- EBTOK #365: viggahikakatham anuyutta = reclused and brahmins who are addicted to the debate (D I 8, M II 243, S III 11), introduced by the sentence katham viggayha katta hoti = how is one a contentious debater (S II 11).
- EBTOK #373: "reasons were being adduced in proof of the theories put forward by various proponents at this time and that the validity of this reasoning was being questioned by their opponents. There seems to have been, therefore, a conception of valid and invalid reasoning (cp. sutakkitam pi.. . duttakkitam pi hoti, M. L520) at this time. This reasoning is called takka (Sn. 885, 886) and as we have seen, it is said that 'people say the two things "true" and "false" by employing takka on views' (Sn. 886). What is probably meant is that in the process of debating people utilize reason to prove that certain theories are true and others false."
- EBTOK #373: "The problem is whether these theories were both constructed by takka- as well as defended by takka-. There is no doubt that all these theories that were debated were defended or criticized by takka, but it is doubtful whether all of them were also constructed by takka, although no doubt a good many of them probably were (y. infra, 435)"
_ EBTOK #374: "Of the sixty two theories mentioned in the Brahmajäla Sutta only four (D. 1.16, 21, 23, 29) are specifically associated with the takki and are said to be 'constructed by takka' takka-pariyähatam, loc. ciu As for the others it is implied that some (e.g. the three 'Eternalist' (sassataväda) and the three 'Semi-Eternalist' (ekacca-sassata-väda) theories (other than the two attributed to takka), are at least not wholly due to takka (v. infra, 416) but to jhänic perception, while it is not specified whether the others (e.g. the Materialist and Survivalist theories) are due to takka or not. 
- EBTOK #419: "the term takki is quite clearly used of a 'rationalist' in the sense of a 'pure reasoner' (suddha-takkika) who constructed a metaphysical theory on the basis of reasoning. In this sense takki and vimamsi (investigator, speculator) go together. There are four such theories mentioned in the Brahmajäla Sutta, as being the product of such rational speculation. We may examine them to see the kind of reasoning on which they are based.": -> D I 16
- EBTOK #435: "We are now in a position to see that the term takka- meant in the Päli Nikäyas either (i) the kind of reasoning with which the theories, which were debated at this time, were defended or criticized, even if they may not have been in origin products of reasoning at all, or (ii) the kind of reasoning with which the speculative, rational metaphysical theories were constructed and which the commentator has called 'pure reasoning'. We found that these latter appear to have been constructed on the basis of a priori reasoning, but the instances were too few and their identity too uncertain for us to be quite sure about this. So when it was enjoined that 'one should not accept (a theory) on the grounds of takka-' (mä takka-hetu, v. supra, 314), it meant that 'reasoning' of the type (i) or (ii) should not be considered as giving knowledge of the truth of these theories." + ref to Sandaka Sutta

- MN 74: A bhikkhu whose mind is liberated thus [...] sides with none and disputes with none; he employs the speech currently used in the world without adhering to it." -> MA then quotes SN 1:5/i.14), also see DN 9.53/i.202

Opposing schools:
- Ajita Kesakambali (D I 55), the materialist
- materialists in general (D I 34, 35)
- the soul is the same as the body (D I 160)
- the soul exists after death (D I 188)
- tathagato = soul ?? (DA I 118)

- tathagata exis
ts after death + 3 other alternatives (D I 27 + Ud 67)
- Makkhali Gosala denies "free will" (D I 53)
- Purana Kassapa denies "moral government" (D I 52)
- Casuistic: Saccaka boasts about his dialectical invicibility (M I 227, 237)
- moral sceptics (amaravikkhepika)
- Ajivakas, Ajita of the Hair-garment (???)
- "Sanjaya the sophist": was probably limited to the range of transcendent propositions

What schools are afraid of:
- feat or disgust at anuyoga (D I 26) ?
- afraid of falsehood (D I 25)
- vexation can result from debate (M I 499)

Distinction between 2 ways to hold views (EBTOK):
- dogmatically, "note giving it up as a view and the possibility of changing it for another" (M I 398)
- non-dogmatically and disinterestedly "giving it up as a view and with no possibility of changing it for another" (M I 398)

EBTOK $332: "That the Buddhist attitude to the sceptics (amaravikkhepika) was on the whole a favourable one is also apparent from the place they receive in the Sandaka Sutta (M I 520, 521), where the religion of these sceptics was classified as one of the four unsatisfactory but not totally false religions. It also tends to confirm our supposition that the sceptics, despite their intellectual scepticism had a conception of the moral and religious life."


a) professed controversialists, materialist or sceptical air

#### Inference [naya-hetu]

TBD

#### Ponderation [akara-parivitakka-hetu]

- EBTOK #438, citescommentary: 'thinking that this is a good reason after reflecting over reasons in this manner' (sundaram idam käranan ti evam kärana-parivitakkena, A A. II. 3 05)
- occurence in D I 138, D I 139 but different meaning
- EBTOK #439: occurence in M I 320, in the sense of "reason" : "what were the reasons (akara) or the grounds (anvaya) on which he says that 'the Exalted One is perfectly enlightened' [...] he should be in a position to reply that he has studies the dhamma and 'had come to realize by his own personal higher knowledge the truth of part of the dhamma and has come to the conclusion (on this basis) that 'the Exalted One was perfectly enlightened'".
- TODO: "how own personal higher knowledge" => "nana" ? check #666

### Reflection [ditthi-nijjhana-kkhanti]

- EBTOK #440 cites commentary 'because it agrees with our theory accepted after consideration and after being convinced of it' (amhäkam nijjhäyitvä khamitvä gahita-ditthiyä saddhim sameti, AA. II. 305).
- EBTOK #440 refs M I 133, nijjhänam khamati occurs as a single phrase to describe the conviction that dawns after thinking about a theory (or the dhamma) and 
intelligently examining its meaning.
- EBTOK #442: Pancattaya Sutta records sixteen theories, which are said to be accepted on subjective considerations, as well as the kind of rational reflexion. (M I 234)
- Canki Sutta M I 170

#### Notes

We're focusing here on this sentence:
> Etha tumhe, kālāmā, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭaka­sam­padā­nena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāra­pari­vitak­kena, mā diṭṭhi­nij­jhā­nak­khan­tiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā samaṇo no garūti.

We're looking in other texts for combinations of those three [lists/matikas](../docs/matikas.md):
- list 1: [anussavena], [paramparāya], [itikirāya], [piṭaka­sam­padā­nena]
- list 2: [takkahetu], [nayahetu], [ākāra­pari­vitak­kena], [diṭṭhi­nij­jhā­nak­khan­tiyā]
- list 3: [bhabbarūpatāya], [samaṇo no garūti]

_Note: Results extracted using [matika-finder](https://github.com/therabyte/matika-finder), occurences of only one single term have not been considered._

Findings:
- list 1 is included in a list of "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis", criticized in SN12.68, SN35.153, MN102, MN76, MN95: faith [saddhā], personal preference [ruci], oral tradition [anussavā], reasoned reflexion [ākāraparivitakkā], acceptance of a view after pondering itth [diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti]
- these expression are related to a larger argument around the access knowledge, how to claim knowledge.

Below is a visualization of co-occurences between those terms:

![visualization of co-occurences](img/matikaviz-10-acceptance-thesis.png)


### B. "When you know for yourselves..."

We're focusing here on this sentence:
> Yadā tumhe, kālāmā, attanāva jāneyyātha: ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṃvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, kālāmā, pajaheyyātha.

This pattern would be built around the expression "attanāva jāneyyātha". But the only occurences of this exact expression (see [query "attanāva jāneyyātha"](https://suttacentral.net/search?query=%22attan%C4%81va+j%C4%81neyy%C4%81tha%22&lang=)) are AN3.35, AN3.36, AN4.193 (see below).

Considering the suttas related to the first pattern, this could be another expression of the right way to access and claim knowledge of a view (as "personal knowledge" [paccattameva ñāṇa] from SN12.68, or "seeing with wisdom" [dhammā paññāya disvā veditabbā] the extinction of taints as in SN35.153).

TODO: pajānanti from MND16

# Kesaputtiya Sutta (a.k.a. Kalama Sutta) - AN 3.65

This page presents an analysis and commentary on the Kesaputtiya Sutta, more widely known as the Kalama Sutta. This piece of scripture has often been used in texts introducing Buddhism under a modernist perspective. We'd like to deep dive into this text and relate it to popular interpretations of it.

## The text of the Sutta itself

- English: **Aṅguttara Nikāya / The Book of the Threes / 65. Kesaputtiya** [suttacentral.net/en/an3.65](https://suttacentral.net/en/an3.65)
- Pali: **Aṅguttara Nikāya 3 / 7. Mahāvagga / 65. Kesamuttisutta** [suttacentral.net/pi/an3.65](https://suttacentral.net/pi/an3.65)

## How is the Kalama Sutta spoken about?

In this section, we examine some references to the Sutta by Buddhists authors or scholars. **Highlights** are from us.

### Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 1994

Kalama Sutta: To the Kalamas, translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, 1994 \[[accesstoinsight.org]\](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.065.than.html)

_Although this discourse is often cited as the Buddha's carte blanche for following one's own sense of right and wrong, it actually says something much more rigorous than that. **Traditions are not to be followed simply because they are traditions**. Reports (such as historical accounts or news) are not to be followed simply because the source seems reliable. One's own preferences are not to be followed simply because they seem logical or resonate with one's feelings. Instead, **any view or belief must be tested** by the results it yields when put into practice; and — to guard against the possibility of any bias or limitations in one's understanding of those results — they **must further be checked against the experience of people who are wise**._

### Soma Thera, 1994

Soma Thera, _Kalama Sutta - The Buddha's Charter of Free Inquiry_, 1994 \[[accesstoinsight.org](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html)]

_The instruction of the Kalamas (Kalama Sutta) is justly famous for its **encouragement of free inquiry**; the spirit of the sutta signifies a **teaching that is exempt from fanaticism, bigotry, dogmatism, and intolerance**._  
_[...] Here it may be mentioned that the methods of examination in the Kalama Sutta and in the extracts cited here, have sprung from the knowledge of things as they are and that the tenor of these methods are implied in all straight thinking. Further, as penetration and comprehension, the constituents of wisdom are the result of such thinking, the place of **critical examination and analysis** in the development of right vision is obvious._  
_[...] More than fifty years ago, Moncure D. Conway, the author of "My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East," visited Colombo. He was a friend of Ponnambalam Ramanathan (then Solicitor General of Ceylon), and together with him Conway went to the Vidyodaya Pirivena to learn something of the Buddha's teaching from Hikkaduve Siri Sumangala Nayaka Thera, the founder of the institution. The Nayaka Thera explained to them the principles contained in the Kalama Sutta and at the end of the conversation Ramanathan whispered to Conway: "Is it not strange that you and I, who come from far different religions and regions, should together listen to **a sermon from the Buddha in favor of that free thought**, that independence of traditional and fashionable doctrines, which is still the vital principle of human development?" — Conway: "Yes, and we with the (Kalama) princes pronounce his doctrines good."_

### Bhikkhu Bodhi, 1998

Bhikkhu Bodhi, A Look at the Kalama Sutta, 1998 \[[accesstoinsight.org](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_09.html)]

> **On the basis of a single passage, quoted out of context, the Buddha has been made out to be a pragmatic empiricist who dismisses all doctrine and faith**, and whose Dhamma is simply a freethinker's kit to truth which invites each one to accept and reject whatever he likes.
> [...] Now this passage, like everything else spoken by the Buddha, has been stated in a specific context — with a particular audience and situation in view — and thus must be understood in relation to that context.
> [...] From the subsequent development of the sutta, it is clear that **the issues that perplexed [the Kalamas] were the reality of rebirth and kammic retribution** for good and evil deeds.
> [...] He next speaks the passage quoted above, advising the Kalamas to abandon those things they know for themselves to be bad and to undertake those things they know for themselves to be good. This advice can be dangerous if given to those whose ethical sense is undeveloped, and we can thus assume that the Buddha regarded the Kalamas as people of refined moral sensitivity.
> [...] the Kalamas, at the start of the discourse, were not the Buddha's disciples. They approached him merely as a counselor who might help dispel their doubts [...] Because the Kalamas had not yet come to accept the Buddha in terms of his unique mission, as the discloser of the liberating truth, it would not have been in place for him to expound to them the Dhamma unique to his own Dispensation: such teachings as the Four Noble Truths, the three characteristics, and the methods of contemplation based upon them.
> [...] Thus the discourse to the Kalamas offers an acid test for gaining confidence in the Dhamma as a viable doctrine of deliverance. We begin with an immediately verifiable teaching whose validity can be attested by anyone with the moral integrity to follow it through to its conclusions, namely, that the defilements cause harm and suffering both personal and social, that their removal brings peace and happiness, and that the practices taught by the Buddha are effective means for achieving their removal. By putting this teaching to a personal test, with only a provisional trust in the Buddha as one's collateral, one eventually arrives at a firmer, experientially grounded confidence in the liberating and purifying power of the Dhamma. This increased confidence in the teaching brings along a deepened faith in the Buddha as teacher, and thus disposes one to accept on trust those principles he enunciates that are relevant to the quest for awakening, even when they lie beyond one's own capacity for verification. This, in fact, marks the acquisition of right view, in its preliminary role as the forerunner of the entire Noble Eightfold Path.
> [...] Partly in reaction to dogmatic religion, partly in subservience to the reigning paradigm of objective scientific knowledge, it has become fashionable to hold, by appeal to the Kalama Sutta, that the Buddha's teaching dispenses with faith and formulated doctrine and asks us to accept only what we can personally verify. This interpretation of the sutta, however, forgets that the advice the Buddha gave the Kalamas was contingent upon the understanding that they were not yet prepared to place faith in him and his doctrine; it also forgets that the sutta omits, for that very reason, all mention of right view and of the entire perspective that opens up when right view is acquired. It offers instead the most reasonable counsel on wholesome living possible when the issue of ultimate beliefs has been put into brackets.
> [...] What can be justly maintained is that those aspects of the Buddha's teaching that come within the purview of our ordinary experience can be personally confirmed within experience, and that this confirmation provides a sound basis for placing faith in those aspects of the teaching that necessarily transcend ordinary experience. Faith in the Buddha's teaching is never regarded as an end in itself nor as a sufficient guarantee of liberation, but only as the starting point for an evolving process of inner transformation that comes to fulfillment in personal insight.

https://archive.org/details/threestepstoawak0000rose/page/n9/mode/2up?q=%22kalama+sutta%22


_Of all the teachings of the Buddha, the Kalama Sutta is one of my favorites precisely because it **encourages such rigorous inquiry into our beliefs**. Indeed, if Buddhism were not infused with the spirit of this sutta — **a spirit of questioning, of critical examination** — I'm quite sure I would not have a meditative practice today._  
_[...] The Kalamas of the Kalama Sutta were, like my father, a **skeptical but responsible** bunch. They were quite alive to spiritual matters, but they were overrun with teachers and teachings, each teacher competing for an audience, each propounding a different philosophy or path. Their situation was not very different from ours now._  
_In the Kalama Sutta, **the Buddha is not saying that ancient teachings are irrelevant, or that you have to reinvent the dharma wheel** every time you think. He's not saying not to accept the guidance of teachers or not to read the scriptures. After all, how else are you going to find out what's criticized and praised by the wise? No, what he's saying is: Don't give final authority to these teachings. Don't give final authority to your own ideas. **You have to test the teachings, and your ideas, in the laboratory of your actions**._  
_So what is the test of truth? The Buddha offers a simple formula: **Test things in terms of cause and effect. Whatever is unskillful, leading to harm and ill, should be abandoned; whatever is skillful, leading to happiness and peace, should be pursued**. Apply the test of skillfulness to all teachings in all your actions._

### Dipen Barua, 2021

Dipen Barua, _The Kalama Sutta: The First Rationalist Buddhist Text?_, 2021 \[[buddhistdoor.net](https://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/the-kalama-sutta-the-first-rationalist-buddhist-text/)\]

> To this day, it is interpreted as a pro-skeptic, pro-rationalist text. In this sutta is a famous passage in which the Buddha argues for a rigorous questioning of religious teachings. Because of this celebrated passage, the text as a whole has been interpreted as advocating the rejection of anything that contradicts rational thought or empirical understanding, even the Buddhist teachings. Or, reframed, anything that is unseen and that cannot be empirically verified is incompatible with the Buddha’s free thinking. Therefore, teachings of the afterlife or karma are superstitious baggage that go against the “original spirit” of the Buddha’s inquiring mind.
> Here, I hope to provide a more rigorous exegesis of the Kalama Sutta, and respond to the rationalist claim that the Kalama Sutta advocates a skeptical approach to all things: it qualitatively does not, and, in fact, the text argues precisely that a free and open mind will lead one to acceptance of the Buddhadhamma.

> The Kalamas were themselves not skeptics because they lacked the knowledge to determine the veracity of a teaching. Rather, they were beset by uncertainty and confusion after encountering diverse and contradictory teachings from various gurus, brahmins, and yogis.

> The rationalist interpretation cherry picks from the first half of the Kalama Sutta, leaving the Kalamas narratively suspended in uncertainty and confusion. However, in the second half of the text, the Buddha provides assurance of the truth, the Dhamma. The Buddha’s unveiling to the Kalamas of the Noble Eightfold Path is the conclusion of the sutta. In a correct exegesis, the Buddha’s 10 points of skepticism are aimed directly at those who doubt his teaching. This is quite a different conclusion to the pro-agnostic, pro-skeptical position advocated by rationalists.

> The rationalist paradigm has dominated academic and broader globalized discourse for decades. Even the Buddhist tradition, particularly in the West after World War Two, partially conceded epistemic understanding to the scientific, empiricist worldview. Both Buddhists and rationalists have cited the Kalama Sutta as legitimizing the rationalist paradigm as an authentically Buddhist position. However, they only refer to the initial portion of the sutta, in which the Buddha states his 10 points of skepticism, while ignoring the rest. Rationalist advocates further argue that in this text, the Buddha did not say anything about an afterlife, and therefore the afterlife, at worst, does not exist, and at best, is a later superstitious accretion that can be dismissed as not belonging to “original Buddhism.”

> We now know that this understanding of early Buddhism is itself a bias shaped by scientism and Protestant-inspired prejudices that date back to early clashes between what early European and American Buddhologists saw as “Buddhist superstition” versus “true Buddhism.” The Buddha, in fact, spoke extensively not only on the subject of the afterlife, but also on rebirth, kamma, and a transcendent, unseen reality. Empiricism is only one aspect of the story—not the whole.

### Bloom, XXXX

Alfred Bloom, _Critical Thinking in Buddhism: The Kalama Sutta_, \[[bschawaii.org](https://bschawaii.org/shindharmanet/critical/)\]

> Here Gotama Buddha gives advice on how seekers should respond when they are confronted by diversity of views concerning the path to enlightenment and spiritual fulfillment, even Gotama’s. He advocates a questioning, inquiring spirit, refusing to accept anything simply based on invoking an authority.

> We are not to simply accept a surmise, something accepted as true while as yet unproven. We make surmises frequently, concluding that something is true, though we may not have all the facts or information. Such conclusions are easily shaped by prejudices and are to be questioned, even when recognized authorities assert them.
> We are not to accept something because it is an axiom, axiomatic, that is, an unquestioned, apparently self evident, or assumed truth. To question an axiom seems to go against reason, but may be the highest reason. Many things once accepted in society as axioms, givens, such as the separation of races, male superiority, that the earth is flat, etc. have given way to questioning, resulting in the progress of society and culture.
> Specious reasoning asserts ideas which are plausible, seemingly correct or logical but with investigation are found to be erroneous or false. They can be what we regard as half truths. Political campaigns and religious debate often employ such assertions.

> As the Buddha charged his disciples at his death to be a refuge to themselves, a light for themselves, so here also the responsibility for determining the truth of your life is within yourself.

### CEDH, 2010

CEDH, _We the Sceptics, brothers of the Kalamas_ (fr trans.), 2010 \[[cedh.info](http://www.cedh.info/kalamas.htm)\]

> We, the Sceptics, who can have no belief, no "faith", no opinion, no certainty, there is only one Way that can satisfy us, rejoice us, the Way of the Dharma.
> Voici le Sutta aux Kālāmā, les sceptiques du temps du Bouddha. Il montre qu’il est possible de suivre cette Voie sans aucun a priori, simplement en « voyant » les phénomènes tels qu’ils sont.
> Le Dharma du Bouddha n’est pas une religion, ce n’est pas non plus une philosophie, à moins que l’on égale Prajñā et Sophia – elles ont en commun quelques caractères, mais ne peuvent être confondues.
> Ce Dharma est une voie négative par excellence, une voie qui conduit à l’Absolu, qui donne accès à l’Absolu, au « sans conditions », résolvant ainsi tout problème phénoménal quelque subtil qu’il soit. En effet, toutes les difficultés humaines proviennent de l’impact des phénomènes, des apparences. Les cerveaux, informés par les sens, transforment les données sensorielles, les interprètent, concoctent des fantasmes, échafaudent des opinions, des croyances, des certitudes et vont ainsi vers l’insatisfaction, la peine, la frustration, le malheur, le mal de vivre qui accablent le « moi » illusoire construit lui-même par ces cerveaux obscurcis, par la psyché aveuglée, par le cœur obnubilé.

### Dharmapala, 1892

Anagarika Dharmapala, _Life and Teachings of the Buddha_, 1892 \[[archive.org](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.217594)\]]

> Buddhism may be called the Religion of Analysis. It analyses every phase of cosmic phenomenon, the constituents that go to make up a human being, and the differentiating states of mentality; it categorizes the differentiation of Good, Evil and Neutral; it rejects every phase of superstitious belief that is based on mere tradition, speculation, revelations, magic, analogy, logic, authority, and collected discourses, and appeals to the purified heart to distinguish the good from the bad, and to avoid doing anything that is correlated with covetousness, anger and lust. All that is pure and free from covetousness, anger and lust are productive of good, and therefore to be acted upon. Such was the doctrine that the Blessed One enunciated to the chiefs of the Kalama country which is elucidated in detail in the Kalama sutta of the Anguttara Nikaya.


### Gombrich, 1996

Richard F. Gombrich, _How Buddhism Began_, 1996

> There can be no doubt that the Buddha’s emphasis was on experience: the experience he had had himself and the experience he wanted others to have too. While he often
appeals to reason, in the sense that he uses rational argument, the appeal to experience is even more important.
> Modern rationalist expositors like to draw attention to the Kalama Sutta (AN III, 65, AN I, 188–193), in which the Buddha advises the Kalama clan not to accept any teaching
merely on a teacher’s authority, but to work things out for
themselves. 
> However, he also proceeds to preach to them by asking them at each step whether they agree; he is appealing to their experience – we might also call it their common sense.
> Moreover, the content of the sermon is to show that morality has practical advantages. Again, the text is pragmatic and anti-theoretical.

TODO: "It is only in poetry, in the last two books of the
Sutta-nipata, that the Buddha takes quietism to the point of claiming that he, or (more impersonally) the true sage, has no views (e.g. verses 787, 800, 882); and indeed it is to these poems that L.O. Gomez is referring in his article ‘Proto-Madhyamika in the Pali Canon’ (Gomez, 1976).""

> When this presumed association between religion and Buddhism is scrutinized, it is not difficult to see that most of what constitutes the foundation of these arguments involves hair- splitting; selectively picking apart the teachings of the Buddha in order to find anything that is closest-to or similar-to the doctrines of the World’s religions. However, searching through the entire corpus of the Buddha’s teachings, it is difficult, to say the least, to find anything close to or similar to this worldview

>  “When you know for yourselves…” meaning that each 
individual can only verify the veracity of his 
teachings based on one’s own direct personal 
experience by application of his teachings.

> It can be seen from the Kalama Sutta that the Buddha calls for free and total investigation. It is no exxageration if we say that Buddhism about 2500 years ago had the best ideas, thoughts, techniques and methods for the development of the modern organizations and solutions for the managerial problems and conflicts.

> In Kalama Sutta, the Buddha emphatically says : that “Do not believe in anything (simply) because you have heard | it. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. Do not believe in anything (simply) because it is found and written in your religious books. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.? Management also a systemized body of knowledge is aimed at transforming the inputs into outputs through positive behaviour, adopting systems and standards. The management process of planning, organizing, staffing, co-ordinating is a systematic design to achieve the goals of the organizations.

The ability to question and test one's beliefs in an appropriate way is called appropriate attention. The ability to recognize and choose wise people as mentors is called having admirable friends. According to Iti 16-17, these are, respectively, the most important internal and external factors for attaining the goal of the practice. For further thoughts on how to test a belief in practice, see MN 61, MN 95, AN 7.79, and AN 8.53. For thoughts on how to judge whether another person is wise, see MN 110, AN 4.192, and AN 8.54.

## Textual patterns and matikas

There are three notable patterns in the text:
1. _"Do not go by..."_: 
2. _"When you know for yourselves..."_: 
3. The four assurances: 

The first two attract a lot of attention in secular reinterpretations of Buddhism. 


### A. "Do not go by..."

#### Anussava

- K. N. Jayatilleke, _Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge_, 1936 \[[ahandfulofleaves.org](http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Early%20Buddhist%20Theory%20of%20Knowledge_Jayatilleke.pdf)\], especially pp 182-188, 274-76

> We found three possible senses in which the word is used: (1) as used of the Vedic tradition 
the word could mean 'divine revelation', systematically handed down; (2) it could also have meant 'authoritative tradition' the source of its authority being not clearly perceived or defined—in this sense it could have meant any tradition including or other than the Vedic; (3) lastly, it could have meant a 'report' come from mouth to mouth(cp. J. Li58, which comments on the particle 'kira' used in statements conveying information received from 'hearsay', as anussavatthe nipäto, i.e. a particle in the sense of 'hearsay').  
> [...] We find \[_in M II 170 I_\] the Buddha asserting that a belief based on anussava can have the twofold result of turning out to be either true or false. Even if the assertion be from the most reliable revelation, tradition or report (anussava), there is no guarantee that it is true and it may very well be false. The right attitude to take is to suspend judgment regarding the truth of the assertion or proposition thus heard and say that 'I have heard p from anussava- but I do not claim to know p since p maybe false!' This is clearly a rejection of revelation, tradition or report as a pramäna or a valid means of knowledge.

#### Logic [takka-hetu]

Opponents using reason?
- Takki (D I 16)
- Takkika (ud. 73)

"The commentary explains takka-hetu as 'takka-gahena'(AA. II.305), which may be translated by either 'by comprehending reasons' or 'by adhering to logic'.

"[Takka] does not make much sense however the word may be translated, unless we know who the takki and takkika were and what kind of takka they employed."

Nyaya Sutra (N.S. 1.2.1)
In the context of the Nikaya, "denote the reasoning that was employed to construct and defend metaphysical theories and perhaps meant the reasoning of sophists and dialecticians only in a secondary sense."

Three doctrines - everything appears to me true, everything appears to me untrue, some views appear to me true some false.
- "Those who firmly hold and dogmatically assert that any one of these theories is alone true and the others false"(M I 498) is likely to engage in contentious debate with their other two opponants, resulting in dispute, vexation and worry.
- "The Buddha speaks well of the second point of view as tending towards dispassion and lack of attachment, excitement, dogmatism and involvement [...] but the Buddha goes on to explain that holding the second view dogmatically and clinging to it is as bad as holding the other views."
- B. Bodhi, MN, note 734: "MA identifies the three views here as eternalism, annihilationism, and partial eternalism.", but note 713 "MA holds that Dighanakha is an annihilationist and explains [the 2nd assertion] to mean 'no mode of rebirth is acceptable to me', however the text itself does not give any concrete evidence supporting this interpretation."
- See MN 76.30 "eel-wrigglers" satire of the radical scepticism
- EBTOK $333: "Now, according to the commentary not only is Dighanakha said to be a materialist/annihilationist) but 'sabbam me na khamati' is interpreted differently. 'Sabbam' is said to be 'all rebirths and conceptions, which do not please him' (MA III 204)". <<< ??? not sure about EBTOK's translation of MA here >>>
- EBTOK $334: _"This commentarial identification of him as a Materialist is in fact confirmed by the text as well. In the course of the dialogue the Buddha tells Dighanakha that he should regard 'the body which has form,.is composed of the four primary elements and arises from father and mother (käyo rüpl cätummahäbhütiko mätapettika-sambhavo, M. I.500) as not a soul (anattato samanupassitabbo, loc. cit.J. The wording is unusual,2 occurs rarely and is identical with the phraseology used to describe the first school of the Materialists (viz. attä rüpl cätummahäbhütiko mätäpettikasambhavo, D. I.34). It appears as if the Buddha was making a specific criticism of the Materialist theory. There is therefore reason to think that Dighanakha was in fact a Materialist."_
- EBTOK #335: 1st view = Relativism: "The opposite of Dighanakha's view 'sabbam me khamati' (I agree with every view) is also said to be held by a school of recluses and brahmins (eke samanabrähmanä, loc. eh.). This point of view resembles, if it is not identical with the anekäntaväda of the Jains. According to this theory every view is true from some standpoint (naya) or other and in general3 no view can be categorically false. "
- EBTOK #335: _"The commentary is not helpful in identifying [the 1st view] since it makes no direct comment on it, but it seems indirectly to suggest or assume that 'Sabbam me khamati' is the eternalist view being the opposite of Dighanakha's Materialist position while 'ekaccam me khamati...' (I agree with some views) is said to be the semi-eternalist view. But this explanation is far-fetched and therefore inadmissible for had the compiler of this sutta been thinking of the eternalist or semi-eternalist views there is no reason why he should not have employed more direct and less ambiguous language and said 'sassatam (or sassata-ditthi) me khamati' instead of 'sabbam me khamati' and 'ekaccasassatam (or ekaccasassata-ditthi) me khamati' instead of 'ekaccam me khamati ekaccam me na khamati'."_
- EBTOK $340: "Another set of thinkers who appear prima facie to be vitandavädins are the recluses and brahmins, whom the third school of Sceptics (v. supra, 167) feared would engage them in debate. They were described as 'learned (panditä), subtle (nipunä), hairsplitters (välavedhirüpä), who have mastered the doctrines of others (kataparappavädä)3 and who go about shattering (vobhindantä) with their 
intelligence (pannägatena) the theories put forward (ditthigatäni)' (D. I. 26).", also see S V 73 Kundaliya, and M I 133 (TODO: look for vadapamokkha?)
- EBTOK #343: ref M I 133 and its commentary _"what is meant according to this explanation is that some people learn the Dhamma either for the mere sake of defending it against others' criticisms or for the sake of criticizing with its help the theories of others. And this is condemned, for the Dhamma according to this Sutta is to be regarded as a plan of action and not as a theory to be clung to and pitted against other theories in debate either for the purposes of defending it or criticizing with its aid opposing theories."
- EBTOK #347 ref A V 230:

- EBTOK #359: "From our investigations so far we found that with the possible exception of Sanjaya's school there was little evidence for the existence of sophists in the Greek sense of the term. It is however not unlikely that there were quite a few vitandavädins among the dialecticians (kataparappavädä .. . vobhindantä caranti) but as we have shown there is no reason to believe that the majority of them belonged to this class. There is no evidence in Pali literature that either of these two classes were called takki, although the word takka (tarka) was later employed in the Nyäyasütra to denote an indirect argument used to disprove one's opponent's thesis."

- EBTOK #365: viggahikakatham anuyutta = reclused and brahmins who are addicted to the debate (D I 8, M II 243, S III 11), introduced by the sentence katham viggayha katta hoti = how is one a contentious debater (S II 11).
- EBTOK #373: "reasons were being adduced in proof of the theories put forward by various proponents at this time and that the validity of this reasoning was being questioned by their opponents. There seems to have been, therefore, a conception of valid and invalid reasoning (cp. sutakkitam pi.. . duttakkitam pi hoti, M. L520) at this time. This reasoning is called takka (Sn. 885, 886) and as we have seen, it is said that 'people say the two things "true" and "false" by employing takka on views' (Sn. 886). What is probably meant is that in the process of debating people utilize reason to prove that certain theories are true and others false."
- EBTOK #373: "The problem is whether these theories were both constructed by takka- as well as defended by takka-. There is no doubt that all these theories that were debated were defended or criticized by takka, but it is doubtful whether all of them were also constructed by takka, although no doubt a good many of them probably were (y. infra, 435)"
_ EBTOK #374: "Of the sixty two theories mentioned in the Brahmajäla Sutta only four (D. 1.16, 21, 23, 29) are specifically associated with the takki and are said to be 'constructed by takka' takka-pariyähatam, loc. ciu As for the others it is implied that some (e.g. the three 'Eternalist' (sassataväda) and the three 'Semi-Eternalist' (ekacca-sassata-väda) theories (other than the two attributed to takka), are at least not wholly due to takka (v. infra, 416) but to jhänic perception, while it is not specified whether the others (e.g. the Materialist and Survivalist theories) are due to takka or not. 
- EBTOK #419: "the term takki is quite clearly used of a 'rationalist' in the sense of a 'pure reasoner' (suddha-takkika) who constructed a metaphysical theory on the basis of reasoning. In this sense takki and vimamsi (investigator, speculator) go together. There are four such theories mentioned in the Brahmajäla Sutta, as being the product of such rational speculation. We may examine them to see the kind of reasoning on which they are based.": -> D I 16
- EBTOK #435: "We are now in a position to see that the term takka- meant in the Päli Nikäyas either (i) the kind of reasoning with which the theories, which were debated at this time, were defended or criticized, even if they may not have been in origin products of reasoning at all, or (ii) the kind of reasoning with which the speculative, rational metaphysical theories were constructed and which the commentator has called 'pure reasoning'. We found that these latter appear to have been constructed on the basis of a priori reasoning, but the instances were too few and their identity too uncertain for us to be quite sure about this. So when it was enjoined that 'one should not accept (a theory) on the grounds of takka-' (mä takka-hetu, v. supra, 314), it meant that 'reasoning' of the type (i) or (ii) should not be considered as giving knowledge of the truth of these theories." + ref to Sandaka Sutta

- MN 74: A bhikkhu whose mind is liberated thus [...] sides with none and disputes with none; he employs the speech currently used in the world without adhering to it." -> MA then quotes SN 1:5/i.14), also see DN 9.53/i.202

Opposing schools:
- Ajita Kesakambali (D I 55), the materialist
- materialists in general (D I 34, 35)
- the soul is the same as the body (D I 160)
- the soul exists after death (D I 188)
- tathagato = soul ?? (DA I 118)

- tathagata exis
ts after death + 3 other alternatives (D I 27 + Ud 67)
- Makkhali Gosala denies "free will" (D I 53)
- Purana Kassapa denies "moral government" (D I 52)
- Casuistic: Saccaka boasts about his dialectical invicibility (M I 227, 237)
- moral sceptics (amaravikkhepika)
- Ajivakas, Ajita of the Hair-garment (???)
- "Sanjaya the sophist": was probably limited to the range of transcendent propositions

What schools are afraid of:
- feat or disgust at anuyoga (D I 26) ?
- afraid of falsehood (D I 25)
- vexation can result from debate (M I 499)

Distinction between 2 ways to hold views (EBTOK):
- dogmatically, "note giving it up as a view and the possibility of changing it for another" (M I 398)
- non-dogmatically and disinterestedly "giving it up as a view and with no possibility of changing it for another" (M I 398)

EBTOK $332: "That the Buddhist attitude to the sceptics (amaravikkhepika) was on the whole a favourable one is also apparent from the place they receive in the Sandaka Sutta (M I 520, 521), where the religion of these sceptics was classified as one of the four unsatisfactory but not totally false religions. It also tends to confirm our supposition that the sceptics, despite their intellectual scepticism had a conception of the moral and religious life."

#### Notes

We're focusing here on this sentence:
> Etha tumhe, kālāmā, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭaka­sam­padā­nena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāra­pari­vitak­kena, mā diṭṭhi­nij­jhā­nak­khan­tiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā samaṇo no garūti.

We're looking in other texts for combinations of those three [lists/matikas](../docs/matikas.md):
- list 1: [anussavena], [paramparāya], [itikirāya], [piṭaka­sam­padā­nena]
- list 2: [takkahetu], [nayahetu], [ākāra­pari­vitak­kena], [diṭṭhi­nij­jhā­nak­khan­tiyā]
- list 3: [bhabbarūpatāya], [samaṇo no garūti]

_Note: Results extracted using [matika-finder](https://github.com/therabyte/matika-finder), occurences of only one single term have not been considered._

Findings:
- list 1 is included in a list of "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis", criticized in SN12.68, SN35.153, MN102, MN76, MN95: faith [saddhā], personal preference [ruci], oral tradition [anussavā], reasoned reflexion [ākāraparivitakkā], acceptance of a view after pondering itth [diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti]
- these expression are related to a larger argument around the access knowledge, how to claim knowledge.

Below is a visualization of co-occurences between those terms:

### B. "When you know for yourselves..."

We're focusing here on this sentence:
> Yadā tumhe, kālāmā, attanāva jāneyyātha: ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṃvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, kālāmā, pajaheyyātha.

This pattern would be built around the expression "attanāva jāneyyātha". But the only occurences of this exact expression (see [query "attanāva jāneyyātha"](https://suttacentral.net/search?query=%22attan%C4%81va+j%C4%81neyy%C4%81tha%22&lang=)) are AN3.35, AN3.36, AN4.193 (see below).

Considering the suttas related to the first pattern, this could be another expression of the right way to access and claim knowledge of a view (as "personal knowledge" [paccattameva ñāṇa] from SN12.68, or "seeing with wisdom" [dhammā paññāya disvā veditabbā] the extinction of taints as in SN35.153).

This time the discourse is given by Venerable Nandaka to Salha and Rohana. Nandaka starts directly by saying to Salhla this paragraph seen in [AN3.65](https://suttacentral.net/pi/an3.65/) (_"Come, Salha, do not go by..."_).

Then Nandaka unfolds the same reasoning as in AN3.65: abandoning practices and views rooted in greed [lobha], aversion [dosa] and delusion [moha], and that lead to suffering.

This time, greed [lobha] is said to mean "longing" [abhijjhā], and that longing leads to wrong deeds. Aversion [dosa] is said to mean "ill will" [byāpāda], idem. And delusion [moha] is said to mean "ignorance" [avijjā].

In this sutta, Nandaka doesn't mention the four assurances. Instead, he says that the noble disciple, as a reward of abandoning greed, aversion, delusion, understands thus: _"There is this; there is the inferior; there is the superior; there is a further escape from whatever is involved with perception."_ And he is liberated from taints.
note 462 ref to [MN7.17](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn7/) four divine abodes?

[B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, note 462 p 1654] adds that the commentary (Anguttara Nikaya-atthakatha) establishes a relation between these four and the four noble truths:
- "there is this": five aggregates, truth of suffering
- "inferior": truth of the origin of suffering
- "superior": truth of the path
- "further escape": nibbana, truth of cessation

**Paragraph [{'class': ['sc'], 'id': '3'}, {'class': ['pts'], 'id': 'pts2.191'}, {'class': ['ms'], 'id': 'p_15A4_1199'}]**

In this sutta, Baddhiya comes to the Buddha because he heard that _"the ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects"_ ([B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, p567], see also note 907 ref to [SN42.13](https://suttacentral.net/pi/sn42.13) and [MN56.8](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn56)). The Buddha dispells how "some ascetics and brahmins untruthfully, baselessly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresent [him]" by saying this. He uses the same sutta as in AN 3.65 to show what his conversion is about: abandoning practices and views rooted in greed [lobha], aversion [dosa] and delusion [moha], and that lead to suffering (with vehemence [sārambha] added in the mix).

This time the Buddha doesn't mention the four assurances. But he asks Baddhiya: _"did I say to you: 'Come, Bhaddiya, be my disciple and I will be your teacher'?"_. Bhaddiya says no. The emphasis seems to be on the choice Bhaddiya made to go to the Buddha for refuge on his own.

After having said how beneficial it would be for basically everyone to convert that way (in note 911, B. Bodhi refers to MN56.26 at this point), at the very end of the sutta, there is this interesting paragraph:
> "If these great sal trees would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to the welfare and happiness even of these great sal trees for a long time, if they could choose. How much more then for a human being!" [B. Bodhi, AN, 2012, p 570]

_Note: B. Bodhi note 912 mentions that "sace ceteyyum" ("if they could choose") is found in Sinhala-script and Roman-script but not Burmese-script._

This sutta reports an exchange happening between the four Venerables Musila, Savittha, Narada and Ananda.

Savittha asks Musila the following question:

> Friend Musila, apart from faith, apart from personal preference, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned reflexion, apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it, does the Venerable Musila have personal knowledge thus: 'With birth as condition, aging-and-death [comes to be]?' [B. Bodhi, SN, p. 612]

This unfolds along the list of factors of dependent origination. And the final point is Savittha saying "I know this (TODO: which "know" here?), I see this: 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence'". To that sentence, Musila concludes that Savittha is an Arahant.

But Narada interrupts. And an exchange of the same kind unfolds into a discussion on the point that it is not enough to know and see 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence' to be an arahant. That one needs also to extinguish all taints related to this view, to make "bodily contact" with this truth (use of a simile).

In his notes, B.Bodhi points to a discussion on the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis" [B. Bodhi, SN, note 198, p 781] which are here put in comparison with "Personal knowledge" [paccattameva ñāṇa], and are also criticized in SN35.153 (see below):
- faith [saddhā]
- personal preference [ruci]
- oral tradition [anussavā]
- reasoned reflexion [ākāraparivitakkā]
- acceptance of a view after pondering itth [diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti]

Pointed out in [B. Bodhi, SN, note 198, p 781] as another sutta criticizing the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis".

In this sutta, the investigation related to **how a Bhikkhu can declare** [] - 'Detroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being'.

The answer the Buddha provides is related to one, having seen a form, a sound with the ear... a mental phenomenon with the mind, "sees with wisdom" [dhammā paññāya disvā veditabbā] that there is no lust, hatred or delusion [lobha, dosa, moha] internally.

> Therein, bhikkhus, as to those reclues and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: 'The self and the world are eternal: only this is true, anything else is wrong,' that apart from faith, apart from approval, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned cogitation, apart from reflective acceptance of a view, they will have any pure and clear personal knowledge of this - that is impossible. Since they have no pure and clear personal knowledge, even the mere fragmentary knowledge that those good recluses and brahmins clarify [about their view] is declared to be clinging on their part. [B. Bodhi, MN, p 843]

Basing acceptance of a thesis on the five grounds (faith, personal preference, oral tradition, reasoned reflexion, acceptance of a view after pondering it) would be considered as clinging to a wrong view.

**Learning Objectives**:  
- Provide guidance or opening your journey into Buddhism
- Explore resources to discover Buddhism

**Motivations** - Discovering Buddhism is an individual journey. No two Buddhists have gone through the same, due to regional differences, or personal circumstance. In addition, Buddhism is a diverse and still active domain of thought seeing new forms emerge regularly.  
As I was once a beginner myself, I tend to think one should let beginners discover Buddhism on their own. I do not wanting to interfere with their journey. For that, this page propose a couple of starting links to initiate that journey by yourself.  
That being said, there are a couple of mistakes and wrong expectations that could be helpful to debug so you start without too many illusions or pre-conceptions or projections. This page provides a couple of aspects to be aware of when you start your journey, and traps to avoid.

## What to be aware of

**True Buddhism is an illusion** - Every Buddhist school, tradition, movement, is deeply rooted in a specific historical context, in a specific culture. From the Tantric Tibetan Buddhism to the Secular Buddhists, all traditions old and new derive from multiple origins, have gone through many transformations, and influence one another all the time. Yet, many schools claim to be expressing "Original Buddhism" or "True Buddhism". This is an illusion. All forms of Buddhism are cultural, and based on roots that are impermanent and interdependent.

Being aware of those roots is important to understand and locate the respective teachings of those schools, and put them in perspective from one another. It also avoids the claim that only your form holds the one true Dharma. Whenever you read an introduction to Buddhism, whenever you listen to a Dharma talk, try to be aware of who's talking and in which context they are.

**Wrong Buddhism is very real** - Although Buddhism is often viewed as a philosophy of life that inspires only peace and morality, in reality, like in any other social group, Buddhism can harbor toxicity, indoctrination, manipulation and violence. Denying this is just another case of [buddhist exceptionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Thompson).

No specific school is exempt from abuse of power, harrassment or coercion. If you join a Buddhist group, please don't overlook this. Be aware of the power dynamic in the group. Try to gauge if the group has a healthy way of dealing with issues, has a proper way of discussing and processing abuse reports; what way do they look at the victims, how do they explain or excuse the abusers.

**Contradiction is healthy** - The intellectual architecture of the Buddha Dharma is complex. Many concepts that are laid out through the scriptures are conflicting with one another (ex: karma and impermanence). Those contradictions, instead of representing an obstacle, can be seen as an opportunity for practice. When you journey through scripture, ask yourself: how could they be embraced as is? (I am not gonna expand on that for now). Also, non-monolithic scripture is actually a good sign, they indicate authenticity.

Finally, they ensure diversity: a healthy community contemplating at contradictions cannot be restricted to one single totalitarian view of what the Dharma is or should be. I think this is why the Dharma is still an active field of discovery, meditation, contemplation, study and debate. Don't try too hard to find a pure and diamond-like theory or philosophy. If you find one, beware.

## Things to avoid

**Fundamentalism is denying impermanence of scripture** - Like all other religious scriptures, Buddhist scriptures have gone through transformations. They have been first written down after a couple centuries of oral tradition, being only remembered and recited. Then, they have been compiled, translated, edited, filtered, re-compiled, commented, etc. That process was human, and necessarily introduced bias, errors, inaccuracies.

Also, those scriptures have been subjected to creative work: long after the passing of the Buddha, some unknown authors created brand new Sutras as inspired by their faith and practice, and presented them as if they had been spoken at the time of the Buddha himself (nobody can possible know if that's true or not). Those introduced brand new concepts, or had a different emphasis than previous scriptures. With time, translation and propagation, those new Sutras became new canons, revered and recited by many Buddhist schools today.

In short: no scripture or canon can pretend to be the one permanent untouched scripture that should be taken literally as the Buddha's original teachings.

Cousins, 1983](http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Articles/Pali%20Oral%20Literature_BSAM_Cousins_1983.pdf); "A Short History of Buddhism", E. Conze, 1980 ; [History of Prajnaparamita Sutras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajnaparamita#History) on Wikipedia

**Consumerism ruins everything** - Once we've established the diversity of the Buddhist practices, it is natural to just pick and choose any form you like from one school, combine with other teachings from another you like too, and try new practices that sound better or that you like more now. You'll find that this kind of journey can be met by a lot of grifters trying to sell you books, workshops, initiation sessions, paid coaching, and maybe even food supplements and whatnot.

At the end of the day, these can tap into very typical hindrances and unwholesome traits of human nature. They will set very attractive expectations, but will fail to deliver.

So, be aware of that impulse during your practice. Why are you taking on this new practice? What makes you attracted to it? Is this relationship healthy and why? How do you establish a solid and consistent foundation in your practice if you add this new element into it?

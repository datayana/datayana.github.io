permalink: /pages/study/buddhism/matika-acceptance-view/
---

In this document, we will look for the occurrences of a specific [matika](http://tibetanbuddhistencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Matika) related to the grounds for the acceptance of a view or doctrine. This list is found in the Pali Canon. In particular, it is found in the [Kesamuttisutta](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/en/sujato) (a.k.a. the Kalama Sutta) where it has been the object of a lot of interpretations and commentaries from modern Buddhist apologists.

**Objectives** - This page will enumerate the occurrences of the list of grounds for the acceptance of a view or doctrine in the Pali Canon. This will be used later (hopefully) for a commentary on the modernist interpretations of the Kalama Sutta.

**Structure** - To support this future commentary, this document will:

- [Section A](#a-the-matika): define the list we used as reference,
- [Section B](#b-occurrences-of-the-matika): locate, as exhaustively as possible, all the full or partial occurrences of the list in the Pali Canon,
- [Section C](#c-mapping-know-for-yourself): examine, in the text surrounding those occurrences, terms that are related to the expression _"when you know for yourself"_ found in the Kalama Sutta.

**Future work** to this document will (hopefully) include:

- polishing and publishing the code used to locate the occurrences from the [Sutta Central](https://suttacentral.net/) corpus,
- adding a section for the occurrences of the terms related to _"when you know for yourself"_ in other suttas.

**Thanks** - The author wants to express the deepest thanks to [Sutta Central](https://suttacentral.net/) for their amazing work of collecting and maintaining an online version of the Pali Canon, and to all the translators, famous or not, that have provided versions of the texts in english.

# A. The matika

The list is known for its use in [AN3.65 Kalama Sutta](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/en/sujato), _"Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by..."_

| Pali                      | English                                                                  |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _anussava_                | oral tradition, oral transmission                                        |
| _parampara_               | lineage of teaching, inheritance, tradition                              |
| _itikirāya_               | hearsay, testament, what seems appropriate                               |
| _piṭakasampadānena_       | collection of scripture, canonical/scriptural authority                  |
| _takkahetu_               | logic, logical reasoning, thought                                        |
| _nayahetu_                | inference, inferential reasoning                                         |
| _ākāraparivitakkā_        | reasoned contemplation/cogitation                                        |
| _diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā_ | acceptance of a view after consideration, after pondering it             |
| _bhabbarūpatāya_          | appearance/semblance of competence of a teacher, competence of a speaker |
| _samaṇo no garūti_        | thinking 'this ascetic is our respected teacher/guru'                    |

It has been refered to by some authors as the _ten grounds for the acceptance of a thesis_ (or view, or doctrine). It lists the grounds that cannot be reliably used as foundations for accepting a view or doctrine, because a view founded on those grounds could eventually be either true or false.

Note: in CND/MND, another element is added: _itihītihaṃ_, for rumor, hearsay.

This list overlaps with another list refered by Bhikkhu Bodhi as the _five grounds of conviction_ or _five grounds for the acceptance of a doctrine_: namely _saddhā_ (faith), _ruci_ (preference), _anussava_ (oral tradition), _ākāraparivitakkā_ (reasoned contemplation), _diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā_ (acceptance after consideration).  
This second list of five occurs fully in SN12.68, SN35.153, MN95 and MN102, and are counted in this document as partial occurrences of the list of ten grounds collected in [section B](#b-occurrences-of-the-matika).

When used in a sutta, the list of ten grounds comes with an advice on what _should_ be used for accepting a doctrine. This advice remains open to interpretation:

> But when you **know for yourselves**: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.

Corresponding in [pali](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/pli/ms) to:

> Yadā tumhe, kālāmā, **attanāva jāneyyātha**: ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, kālāmā, pajaheyyātha.

The list of five grounds (_saddhā_ ...), usually goes with similar expressions refering to knowledge and vision.

In section C, we'll collect all those expressions related to the right method to access knowledge.

# B. occurrences of the matika

This section will identify the occurrences of the matika in the pali canon. We've kept only occurrences of the full or partial matika up to 2 elements (when at least 2 elements of the list come together in a single sutta).

For each occurrence, we provide an extract and some notes to understand its context and how the list is used.

## AN3.65 - Kesaputtiya

English extract: <https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/en/bodhi>

> “It is fitting for you to be perplexed, Kālāmas, fitting for you to be in doubt. Doubt has arisen in you about a perplexing matter.
> Come, Kālāmas, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence of a speaker, or because you think: ‘The ascetic is our guru.’ But when, Kālāmas, you **know for yourselves**: ‘These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,’ then you should abandon them.

Pali extract: <https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/pli/ms>

> “Alañhi vo, kālāmā, kaṅkhituṁ alaṁ vicikicchituṁ. Kaṅkhanīyeva pana vo ṭhāne vicikicchā uppannā.  
> Etha tumhe, kālāmā, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭakasampadānena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāraparivitakkena, mā diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā samaṇo no garūti. Yadā tumhe, kālāmā, **attanāva jāneyyātha**: ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, kālāmā, pajaheyyātha.

### Notes

The Buddha speaks with the Kalamas. Recently, they have been exposed to a lot of different teachers, _"they explain and elucidate their own doctrines, but disparage, denigrate, deride, and denounce the doctrines of others"_. The Kalamas have seen so many Brahmins come and go, each contradicting/belittling the previous ones. It created perplexity and doubt, scepticism towards any Dharma.

There comes the famous list (see extract above), and the advice to _"know for yourselves"_.

The Buddha then goes into multiple examples, leading the Kalamas into investigating what's a good doctrine of morality.

The conclusion reveals the relationship between the "do not go by oral tradition (etc)" and this discourse on discipline: _"it is because of this that this was said"_ [do not go by oral tradition, etc]].

_"The disciple who lives according to this [...] has won four assurances."_

1. if transmigration and karma are real, they will be reborn in a good destination
2. if there is no transmigration and karma, they will still obtain happiness in this life
3. if evil comes to one who does evil, they will be spared (because they have no evil intention)
4. if evil does not come to one who does evil, at least they will be purified.

These four assurances are related to four views on transmigration and karma. That’s the conclusion of this sutta: independently on which view you adopt on the matter of karma and rebirth, if you align your life with the right discipline (sila), according to your own inner experience of wholesomeness/unwholesomeness, and how this leads to happiness/suffering, you will ease your own suffering.

## AN3.66 - Sāḷhasutta

English extract: <https://suttacentral.net/an3.66/en/sujato>

> “Please, Sāḷha and friend, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you **know for yourselves**: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.
>
> [...]
>
> They **understand**: ‘There is this, there is what is worse than this, there is what is better than this, and there is an escape beyond the scope of perception.’ **Knowing and seeing** like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they’re freed, they **know** they’re freed.  
> They **understand**: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’

Pali extract: <https://suttacentral.net/an3.66/pli/ms>

> “Etha tumhe, sāḷhā, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭakasampadānena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāraparivitakkena, mā diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā samaṇo no garūti. Yadā tumhe, sāḷhā, **attanāva jāneyyātha** ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, sāḷhā, pajaheyyātha.
>
> [...]
>
> So evaṁ **pajānāti**: ‘atthi idaṁ, atthi hīnaṁ, atthi paṇītaṁ, atthi imassa saññāgatassa uttari nissaraṇan’ti. Tassa **evaṁ jānato evaṁ passato** kāmāsavāpi cittaṁ vimuccati, bhavāsavāpi cittaṁ vimuccati, avijjāsavāpi cittaṁ vimuccati; vimuttasmiṁ vimuttamiti **ñāṇaṁ** hoti.  
>
> ‘Khīṇā jāti, vusitaṁ brahmacariyaṁ, kataṁ karaṇīyaṁ, nāparaṁ itthattāyā’ti **pajānāti**.

### Notes

This time the discourse is not given by the Buddha, but by Venerable Nandaka to Salha and Rohana. Nandaka starts directly by saying to Salha this paragraph seen in [AN3.65](https://suttacentral.net/an3.65/pli/ms) (_"Come, Salha, do not go by..."_).

Then Nandaka unfolds the same reasoning as in AN3.65: we need to examine things (_dhammā_) rooted in greed (_lobha_), aversion (_dosa_) and delusion (_moha_), and that lead to suffering, and abandon them.

This time, greed is said to mean "longing" (_abhijjhā_), and that longing leads to wrong deeds. Aversion is said to mean "ill will" (_byāpāda_), idem. And delusion is said to mean "ignorance" (_avijjā_).

In this sutta, Nandaka doesn't mention the four assurances of AN3.65. Instead, he says that the noble disciple, as a reward of abandoning greed, aversion, delusion, _"He **understands** thus: 'There is this; there is the inferior; there is the superior; there is a further escape from whatever is involved with perception.' When he **knows and sees** thus, his mind is liberated from [the taints]. When it is liberated there comes the **knowledge**: 'it's liberated'."_

There's here 3 kinds of knowledge in one paragraph:

- he understands thus: _pajānāti_
- he knows and sees thus:  _evaṁ jānato evaṁ passato_
- he knows (it's liberated): _ñāṇaṁ_

## AN4.193 - Bhaddiyasutta

English extract: <https://suttacentral.net/an4.193/en/sujato>

> “Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you **know for yourselves**: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.

Pali extract: <https://suttacentral.net/an4.193/pli/ms>

> “Etha tumhe, bhaddiya, mā anussavena, mā paramparāya, mā itikirāya, mā piṭakasampadānena, mā takkahetu, mā nayahetu, mā ākāraparivitakkena, mā diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā, mā bhabbarūpatāya, mā ‘samaṇo no garū’ti. Yadā tumhe, bhaddiya, **attanāva jāneyyātha**: ‘ime dhammā akusalā, ime dhammā sāvajjā, ime dhammā viññugarahitā, ime dhammā samattā samādinnā ahitāya dukkhāya saṁvattantī’ti, atha tumhe, bhaddiya, pajaheyyātha.

### Notes

In this sutta, Baddhiya comes to the Buddha because he heard that _"the ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects"_ ([Bhikkhu Bodhi, AN, 2012, p567], see also note 907 ref to [SN42.13](https://suttacentral.net/pi/sn42.13) and [MN56.8](https://suttacentral.net/pi/mn56)).

The Buddha dispells how _"some ascetics and brahmins untruthfully, baselessly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresent [him]"_ by saying this. He uses the same sutta as in AN 3.65 to show what his conversion is about: abandoning things (_dhammā_) rooted in greed, aversion and delusion, and that lead to suffering (with vehemence (_sārambha_) added in the mix).

This time the Buddha doesn't mention the four assurances. But he asks Baddhiya: _"did I say to you: 'Come, Bhaddiya, be my disciple and I will be your teacher'?"_. Bhaddiya says no. The emphasis seems to be on the choice Bhaddiya made to go to the Buddha for refuge on his own.

After having said how beneficial it would be for basically everyone to convert that way (in note 911, Bhikkhu Bodhi refers to MN56.26 at this point), at the very end of the sutta, there is this interesting paragraph: _"If these great sal trees would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to the welfare and happiness even of these great sal trees for a long time, if they could choose. How much more then for a human being!"_ (Bhikkhu Bodhi, AN, 2012, p 570).

Note: Bhikkhu Bodhi note 912 mentions that _sace ceteyyum_ (_"if they could choose"_) is found in Sinhala-script and Roman-script but not Burmese-script.

## SN12.68 - Kosambisutta

English extract: <https://suttacentral.net/sn12.68/en/sujato>

> “Reverend Musīla, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you **know for yourself** that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?”
>
> “Reverend Saviṭṭha, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I **know and see** that rebirth is a condition for old age and death.”

Pali extract: <https://suttacentral.net/sn12.68/pli/ms>

> “aññatreva, āvuso musila, saddhāya aññatra ruciyā aññatra anussavā aññatra ākāraparivitakkā aññatra diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā atthāyasmato musilassa **paccattameva ñāṇaṁ**: ‘jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇan’”ti?
>
> “Aññatreva, āvuso paviṭṭha, saddhāya aññatra ruciyā aññatra anussavā aññatra ākāraparivitakkā aññatra diṭṭhinijjhānakkhantiyā **ahametaṁ jānāmi ahametaṁ passāmi**: ‘jātipaccayā jarāmaraṇan’”ti.

### Notes

This sutta reports an exchange happening between the four Venerables Musila, Savittha, Narada and Ananda.

Savittha asks Musila the following question: _"Friend Musila, apart from faith, apart from personal preference, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned reflexion, apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it, does the Venerable Musila have personal knowledge thus: 'With birth as condition, aging-and-death [comes to be]?'"_ [Bhikkhu Bodhi, SN, p. 610]

This unfolds along the list of factors of dependent origination. And the final point is Savittha saying _"**I know this, I see this**: 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence'"_. To that sentence, Musila concludes that Savittha is an Arahant.

But Narada interrupts. And an exchange of the same kind unfolds into a discussion on the point that it is not enough to **know and see** 'Nibbana is the cessation of existence' to be an arahant. That one needs also to extinguish all taints related to this view, to make "bodily contact" with this truth (use of a simile).

In his notes, Bhikkhu Bodhi points to a discussion on the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis" [Bhikkhu Bodhi, SN, note 198, p 781]. They are here put in contrast with personal knowledge (_paccattameva ñāṇa_), and knowledge and vision (_jānāmi passāmi_).

## SN35.153 - Atthi­nu­kho­pariyā­ya­sutta

English extract: <https://suttacentral.net/sn35.153/en/sujato>

> “There is a method—apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration—that a mendicant can rely on to declare their enlightenment. That is: ‘I **understand**: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’
>
> And what is that method? Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. When they have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they **understand** ‘I have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’ When they don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in them, they understand ‘I don’t have greed, hate, and delusion in me.’ Since this is so, are these things understood by faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration?”
>
> “No, sir.”
>
> “Aren’t they **understood by seeing them with wisdom**?”
>
> “Yes, sir.”

### Notes

Another sutta criticizing the "five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis".

In this sutta, the investigation is on the grounds on which a Bhikkhu can declare: 'Detroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being'.

The answer the Buddha provides is related to one, having seen a form, a sound with the ear... a mental phenomenon with the mind, "sees with wisdom" [dhammā paññāya disvā veditabbā] that there is no lust, hatred or delusion [lobha, dosa, moha] internally.

## MN76 - Sandakasutta

English extract: <https://suttacentral.net/mn76/en/sujato>

> Sandaka, these things have been explained by the Blessed One, who **knows and sees**, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha: four ways that negate the spiritual life, and four kinds of unreliable spiritual life. A sensible person would, to the best of their ability, not practice such spiritual paths, and if they did practice them, they wouldn’t succeed in the procedure of the skillful teaching.”

### Notes

The Blessed One is named "the Blessed One who **knows and sees**".

Ananda speaks to an assembly of wanderer led by Sandaka. He teaches about the four ways that negate the living of the holy life.

1. Holding the view "there is nothing give, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this world, no other world [...]",
2. Holding the view "when one acts or makes other act [...], no evil is done by the doer" and no outcome of evil,
3. Holding the view "there is no cause or condition for the defilement of beings; beings are defiled withotu cause or condition; there is no cause or condition for the purification of beings, beings are purified withotu cause or condition; [...] all beings, all living things, all creatures, all souls are without mastery, power, energy",
4. Holding the view "there are these seven bodies that are unmade, not brought forth, uncreated, without a creator, [these are earth, water, fire, air, pleasure, pain, soul]; herein there is no killer, no slaughterer, no hearer, no speaker; [...] the round of rebirths is limited, there is no shortening or extending it, no increasing or decreasing it".

Those are clearly related to different doctrines of morality, cause and effect / karma. Each time, it is said _"about this a wise man considers thus: [...] 'What do I **know and see** that I should lead the holy life under this teacher?' So when he finds that this way  negates the living of the holy life, he turns away from it and leaves it."_

Ananda then teaches about the four kind of holy life without consolation, wherein a wise man certainly would not live the holy life, or if he should live it, would not attain the true way.

1. "some teacher claims to be omniscient and all-seeing", when asked "how is this?" he replies "I had to...",
2. "some teacher is a traditionalist, one who regards oral tradition as truth; he teaches a Dhamma by oral tradition, by legends handed down, by the authority of the collections",
3. a certain teacher is a reasoner, an inquirer; he teaches a Dhamma hammered out by reasoning, following a line of inquiry as it occurs to him",
4. "a certain teacher is dull and confused; [...] when he is asked such and such a question, he engages in verbal wriggling, in eel-wriggling".

So when the wise man listening to teacher holding this view _"finds that this holy life is without consolation, he turns away from it and leaves it."_

Ananda then speaks of the Tathagata, how the Tathagata went through all jhanas (unfolding this matika in the sutta, as in MN51).

The sutta concludes on a discussion about the status of the Arahant. Notably, Sadanka asks _"when a Bhikkhu is an arahant with taints destroyed [...] is his **knowledge and vision** that his taints are destroyed continuously and uninterruptedly present to him whether he is walking or standing or sleeping or awake?"_ Ananda replies _"his knowledge and vision that his taints are destroyed is not [...], rather, he knows 'My taints are destroyed' only when he reviews this fact."_

Note: that last "knowledge and vision" (_ñāṇadassanaṁ_) is different from the "know and see" (_jānatā passatā_) of the Tathagata.

## MN95 - Caṅkīsutta

English extract: <https://suttacentral.net/mn95/en/sujato>

> “Master Gotama, regarding that which by the lineage of testament and by canonical authority is the ancient hymnal of the brahmins, the brahmins come to the definite conclusion: ‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ What do you say about this?”
>
> “Well, Bhāradvāja, is there even a single one of the brahmins who says this: ‘**I know this, I see this**: this is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?”

“No, Master Gotama.”

> “The brahmins don’t just honor this because of faith, but also because of oral transmission.”

> “First you relied on faith, now you speak of oral tradition. These five things can be seen to turn out in two different ways. What five? Faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, and acceptance of a view after consideration. Even though you have full faith in something, it may be void, hollow, and false. And even if you don’t have full faith in something, it may be true and real, not otherwise.

### Notes

The Buddha is being asked questions by a brahmin student Kapathika. It is said that this student is a sixteen years old clansman, "a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology and grammar, fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man", very learned, has good delivery and is wise.

Kapathika asks (Bhikkhu Bodhi trans.): "In regard to the ancient brahmanic hymns that have come down through oral transmission preserved in the collections the brahmins come to the definite conclusion: 'only this is true, anything else is wrong.' What does the Master Gotama say about this?"

The Buddha replies that none of those brahmins **knows and sees** 'only this is true, anything else is wrong'. Thus placing the discussion about the method to access knowledge, and not the knowledge itself.

He then proceeds with criticizing five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis (faith, personal preference, oral tradition, reasoned reflexion, acceptance of a view after pondering it).

After this, Kapathika asks: "How does one preserve truth?" (_saccānurakkhana_ or safeguarding the truth), meaning how can one speak about some view without relying on those grounds?

The Buddha explains: "He says 'my faith is thus'; but he does not yet come to the definite conclusion: 'only this is true, anything else is wrong'". Same for oral tradition ('my oral tradition is thus'), and reflective acceptance ('my reflective acceptance is thus').

The sutta goes on with explaining how does one discover the truth. The follower investigates a bhikkhu in regard to stats based on greed, hate or delusion. If the bikkhu is purified from states based on greed, hate or delusion, then follows another matika describing a following discovering the truth.

The follower:

- places faith in the bikkhu,
- visits him,
- pays respect,
- gives ear to him,
- hears the Dhamma,
- memorises the Dhamma,
- examines the meaning () of the teachings he has memorized,
- gains a reflective acceptance ()
- zeals springs up and then,
- he applies his will,
- he scrutinises,
- he strives,
- he realises with the body the surpreme truth and sees it by penetrating it with wisdom.

"The final arrival at truth lies in the repetition, development, and cultivation of those same things."

Faith being the first step here, is the faith in the teacher, after examining the teacher is purified from greed, hate and delusion.

## MN102 - Pañ­catta­yasutta

English extract: <https://suttacentral.net/mn102/en/sujato>

> Now, consider the ascetics and brahmins whose view is as follows. ‘The self and the cosmos are eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ It’s simply not possible for them to have **purified and clear personal knowledge** of this, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration. And in the absence of such knowledge, even the partial knowledge that they are clear about is said to be grasping on their part. ‘All that is conditioned and coarse. But there is the cessation of conditions—that is real.’ Understanding this and seeing the escape from it, the Realized One has gone beyond all that.

### Notes

Bhikkhu Bodhi notes that "this sutta is a 'middle length' counterpart of the longer [Brahmajāla Sutta](https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/bodhi)".

The sutta starts with the Buddha telling about _"some recluses and brahmins who speculate about the future"_. Those speculations are related to the nature of the self and its becoming after death. The sutta details multiple views, and how each brahmins holding one of those views criticize the others for some reason.

In a second part, the Buddha tells, similarly, about _"some recluses and brahmins who speculate about the past, who assert various doctrinal propositions about the past"_. Here again, those are mostly about the nature and permanence of the self. In this second part, the Buddha highlights how those recluses and brahmins _"hold such a doctrine and view as this: [...] 'only this is true, anything else is wrong'"_.  
Here the Buddha unfolds the five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis (faith, personal preference, oral tradition, reasoned reflexion, acceptance of a view after pondering it). But, for those recluses and brahmins, "since they have no pure and clear personal knowledge, [their knowledge] is declared to be clinging on their part".

It is noted by Bhikkhu Bodhi, drawing from the commentary, that those different views (future and past) can be mapped to different levels of attainment.

In a third part, the Buddha speaks about those recluses and brahmins who enter some levels of attainment while still clinging to some views of the self not based on clear personal knowledge. _"This good recluse of brahmin [...] regards himself thus: 'I am at peace, I have attained Nibbana, I am without clinging.' Certainly this venerable one asserts the way directed to Nibbana. Yet this good recluse of brahmin still clings"_,  and when they declare they have attained Nibbana, _"that too is declared clinging on the part of this good recluse of brahmin"_.

The Tathagata, _"by understanding as they actually are the origination, the disappearance, the gratification, the danger and the escape in the case of the six bases of contact"_ has discovered the sublime peace that is _"liberation through not-clinging"_.

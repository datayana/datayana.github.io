> **IMPORTANT** - This page will offer a full (personal) commentary on this koan. If you'd rather not be polluted by my thoughts on this case, please **do not read this page**. You can also check out the [version with only prompts](../gateless-gate2.md). Remember, the investigation **has to be your own** (see [introduction](../intro-to-koans)).

## Notes on the text of this case

You can find a version in the ["prompt-only" version of this page](./gateless-case2.md).

The story of Paichang/Baizhang/Hyakujo and the Fox can be found in multiple collections of koans with some variations:
- Case 2 of the Gateless Barrier (_Mumonkan_),
- Case 8 of Book of Serenity (_Shōyōroku_),
- Case 102 of Dogen's Shinji Shobogenzo.

Central to the case, the main question and response is rendered different ways according to translators:

Robert Aitken, The Gateless Barrier, 1990:
> \- Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?  
> \- Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect.  

Koun Yamada Roshi, The Gateless Gate, 1979:
> \- Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?  
> \- The law of cause and effect cannot be obscured.  

Thomas Cleary, Book of Serenity, Case 8, 2005:
> \- Does a greatly cultivated man still fall into cause and effect or not?  
> \- He is not blind to cause and effect.

J.C. Cleary, Wumen's Gate, 2005:
> \- Does a person of great practice still fall into cause and effect or not?  
> \- He is not deluded about cause and effect.

Gudo Nishijima, Master Dogen's Shinji Shobogenzo, Book II case 2, 2003:
> \- Does someone of great Buddhist practice also falls into cause and effect, or not?
> \- Do not be unclear about cause and effect.

Kazuaki Tanahashi, John Daido Loori, The True Dharma Eye case 102, 2005:
> \- Does an enlightened person fall into cause and effect?  
> \- Don't ignore cause and effect.

The Book of Serenity, in covering Case 8, provides "added sayings" as footnotes of the text. Those are interjections, thoughts related to specific lines of the text. Here's a few:
- _"The old man was enlightened at these words - Fox drool is still there."_
- _"For five hundred lives he couldn't do a thing - If he had known what would happen today, he'd regret not being careful to begin with."_
- _"I fell into a wild fox body for five hundred lives - You said one doesn't fall into cause and effect."_

# Commentaries available elsewhere

There are two chapters of Dogen's Shobogenzo, commenting on this case. One is titled "On the Great Practice" (_Daishugyo_) \[[pdf](https://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/073daishugyo.pdf)\], the other "On the Absolute Certainty of Cause and Effect" (_Jinshin Inga_) \[[pdf](http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/088jinshiInga.pdf)\].

# Commentary [work in progress]

- "in my opinion"
- explain the structure
- one point/argument can come back several times, under different reads

## Read 1. Two schools on the nature of enlightenment

> Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is __on the other side of this mountain__.

I bet the other side of __this__ mountain is facing north.

When I read this line, it evokes two things to me.  
First, [Kalu Rimpoche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalu_Rinpoche) used to describe all the vehicles (_yana_) of Buddhism (Hinayana, Mahayana, Vajrayana) as paths on a mountain, all leading to the top, but being different in difficulty and time depending on the side a practitioner is taking.  
Second, the ["Sutra of Hui-neng"](https://www.shambhala.com/the-sutra-of-hui-neng-grand-master-of-zen-1434.html) introduces the distinction between the northern and southern schools of Zen. For an explanation, you can read  [H. Dumoulin, "Zen Enlightenment", pp 44-52](https://www.thriftbooks.com/w/zen-enlightenment-origins-and-meaning_heinrich-dumoulin/623561/item/3095725/), that I have summarized in a [comparison table here](https://datayana.github.io/2019/03/05/Notes).  
I like to think of the expression _"the other side of the mountain"_ as pointing to the difference in doctrine between Hyakujo and the old men.

### Different but still entitled to respect

Before we start putting those schools in competition, it is important for them to respect each other.

> After the meal, Paichang led the monks to the foot of a rock __on the far side of the mountain__. And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then __performed the ceremony of cremation__.

The old man does not belong to the same side of the mountain, still he deserves to receive the ritual owed to a priest.

Even if we belong to different schools, to different traditions, we still owe each other respect, we have to help one another. Here, we are going to forget those differences to allow for a ritual we both share, offering dignity and respect at the passing of our traditional adversary.

### Sudden enlightenment rescueing gradual enlightenment from rebirth

> "In the far distant past, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, I was head priest at this mountain. One day a monk asked me, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I replied, '__Such a person does not fall__ under the law of cause and effect.' With this I was __reborn five hundred times__ as a fox. Please say a turning word for me and release me from the body of a fox."
>
> He then asked Paichang, "Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?"
>
> Paichang said, "__Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect.__"
>
> Hearing this, the old man __immediately was enlightened__. Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox."

This is where the distinction between northern and southern schools of Zen shows up for me.

One interesting exercise is to examine each line according to a distinction between gradual enlightenment or sudden enlightenment.

"**Such a person does not fall...**" - This sounds very much like something said by someone from the school of gradual enlightenment. Maybe the old man comes from the northern school.

"**With this** I was **reborn five hundred times as a fox**" - Again here, the old man holds a view in which a single wrong answer can throw you into a long line of rebirths (that can be exhausted). It sounds to me that the old man still holds the view of gradual enlightenment at this point of the conversation.

"**Such a person does not evade...**" - Hyakujo is providing an answer that fits well in the view of sudden enlightenment.

"**Hearing this, the old man immediately was enlightened**" - Suddenly, the old man enlightened, after being exposed to the view of sudden enlightenment. The old man realizes the truth of this view and suddenly sheds the skin of the fox on the floor of the other side of the mountain.

### Is one view better than the other?

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given __the right answer__ each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"  
> Paichang said, "Just step here closer, and I'll tell you." Huang-po went up to Paichang and __slapped him in the face__.

Now, it would be too easy to just claim victory for one side, to say the view of sudden enlightenment is superior. I read the passage above as indicative that, if you do that, you will be slapped in the face, not just by Huang-po, but also by reality.

There is some irony here though. The old man was suddenly enlightened after discussing with Hyakugo, but he **had to wait** for such a long time, go through so many lives. Who knows how many lives he would have lived if he had now met Hyakujo. Who knows if he could have become enlightened another way. Ultimately, this sounds very much like a gradual path to enlightenment.

Going back to Huang-po's question, "What if...", there's also a lot of irony, almost cynicism. Let's go through it.

"**What if he had given the right answer**" - This seems to imply there **is** a right answer, but Huang-po doesn't say there is one, he's calling out Hyakujo because this story implied there is one. Huang-po's slap suggests that none of those answers are actually right. What to make of this?

"What if he had given **the right answer each time he was asked** a question" - To me, there's two funny aspects about this.  
First, it means you would have to give the right answer the very first time you're being asked. Seriously, could anyone really do that? We're talking about such a fundamental question, if you were asked this question before you understand the true nature of enlightenment, you could very well give the wrong answer. Would you then be reborn as a fox? That doesn't sound very reasonable (or fair). Dogen pointed this out in _Daishugyo_: _"Senior monks who have made mistakes over the past two or three hundred years would certainly have become innumerable foxes"_.  
True understanding of enlightenment is not just something you can deliver like that on your first try, it is something you will realize with time and practice. This points to a contradiction, because _sudden_ enlightenment would then require _gradual_ practice.

Now let's say you _did_ answer properly at some point. Well, you'll still have to answer this question right every single time you're being asked, for the rest of your life, or else you'll be thrown in a long chain of rebirths as a fox. What's the point of being suddenly enlightened if you're still stuck with the possibility of being thrown in hell at every single corner, if you're still stuck within a reality that very much sounds aligned with the view of gradual enlightenment.

"**Huang-po went up to Paichang and slapped him in the face**" - If previously it sounded like the reward for the old man's original answer was to be thrown in rebirths, here it sounds like the reward for Hyakujo's answer is to be slapped in the face. Is Sudden enlightenment, as a view, not "more true" than gradual?. The (Could it be the meaning of Wumen's verses _"a thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes"_?).  
Between us, if I can pragmatic for a second, I'd rather get slapped in the face than be reborn five hundred times as a fox. So, could we just say sudden enlightenment is "less wrong" than gradual enlightenment?

### What if we could hold both together?

What I suggest this read points to, is that the opposition between those two views is a trap, a false dichotomy.

Maybe that's why the _Mumonkan_ closes the case the verses:

> Not falling, not evading--  
> two faces of the same die.  
> Not evading, not falling--  
> a thousand mistakes, ten thousand mistakes.

Each of them leads to a partial understanding of reality and contradictions. Holding one view - sudden enlightenment - might be helpful but grasping it as the one true view is an illusion.

Ultimately, the question is not whether sudden enlightenment is more true than gradual enlightenment. The question is.... what is enlightenment itself? and what is the relationship with the law of cause and effect?

## Read 2. On the law of cause and effect

TODO: Karma is not any cause and effect. Example of five orders in Pali Canon.

Answering the koan is enacting the law of cause and effect, to translate it into action.

### Causality at every word

One interesting exercise is to look for, in the text and between the lines, where causal relationships are present. And even at the very start of the case, it is clear they are everywhere.

> Once when Paichang gave a series of talks, a certain old man was always there listening together with the monks. When they left, he would leave too. One day, however, he remained behind.

"**One day, however, he remained behind.**" - This sentence alone can raise so many questions. What happened **that** day? Why is that day different from the day before? Was Hyakujo teaching on a specific topic? Or did the old man feel he needed to ask a question that day? Why wouldn't he ask that question the day before? What is the cause leading to this old man asking the most pressing question of his existence on that particular day? This day will be important. We're talking about the day of the old man's enlightenment. Conditions on that day seemed more favorable for him than the day before. Why and how?

Once you deep dive like this, reading from the beginning again brings a lot more opportunities to contemplate causality.

"**Once when...**" - When was this exaclty? What happened before?

"**Paichang gave a series of talks..**"- Why was this series of teachings more favorable for the old man to show up? Is this story only about how karmic law applies to the old man? Or is it also about how karmic law applies to Hyakujo? Are those two meeting here as the fruit of a process binding both together?  

"**a certain old man was always there...**" - Was the old man literally **always** there? Like since the beginning of time? Probably not, so he must have entered the teaching hall at some point in the past for the first time. At what point? What happened then? Why at that time?

"**listening together with the monks...**" - Was it just ok for him to just show up like this? Why did nobody notice him or interact with him before?

"**When they left, he would leave too.**" - He was going with the stream. Maybe that can explain why nobody noticed or interacted with him before that day". Did Hyakujo notice him only when he started asking questions?

"**One day, however..** - There the stream meets a boulder, causing the water to stop for a moment. Now, if the old man had never asked any question to Hyakujo, would he still be reborn as a fox again and again?


### Causality at the "wrong" answer

> One day a monk asked me, 'Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?' I replied, 'Such a person does not fall under the law of cause and effect.' **With this** I was reborn five hundred times as a fox.

Dogen: _"If being reduced to the state of a wild fox was the inevitable consequence of answering a trainee’s question inaccurately, then [...] senior monks who have made mistakes over the past two or three hundred years would certainly have become innumerable foxes."_


### Causality at the turning word

> Please say a **turning word** for me and release me from the body of a fox."  

"Turning word" means an expression that can turn someone to realization, to enlightenment. The old man is asking Hyakujo to say such an expression for him. Again we should pause here: what does _requesting_ some turning words mean?

This does not simply mean that the old man is asking Hyakujo for some teachings or some guidance, like you would during a [dokusan](https://www.learnreligions.com/dokusan-449803). This means literally the old man is asking Hyakujo to turn him enlightened. As if that was something you could request like that! Imagine sitting with your teacher in dokusan next time, and demanding for a turning word.

This does not make sense. Enlightenment cannot be just a turning-word-on-demand service. And yet...

> He then asked Paichang, "Does an enlightened person fall under the law of cause and effect or not?"  
> Paichang said, "Such a person does not evade the law of cause and effect."  
> **Hearing this**, the old man immediately was enlightened.

Many Zen stories describe someone realizing enlightenment, through a word or some event. [The record of transmitting the light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denkoroku) is full of those, in the context of Dharma transmissions in the Sōtō lineage.

A careless read of those stories can tend to confer to those acts some kind of magic. It does sound magic indeed that just by hearing Hyakujo's answer - _"..does not evade..."_ - the old man was suddently enlightened. And yet, that answer alone is definitely not magic. When I read it, I didn't become suddenly enlightened, did you? Focusing on the answer itself as if it had some kind of property of enlightenment does not make sense.

Also, as Dogen noted: _"If you were to say, “When someone who was a bystander spoke a triggering phrase concerning causality, that freed another from the mind of a wild fox,” well, the great earth with its mountains and rivers has already been giving forth innumerable triggering expressions concerning causality and is continually doing so. But even so, the old man had not yet dropped off the mind of a wild fox in the past, and he only dropped it off due to [Hyakujo]’s triggering words concerning causality."_

It is not _"hearing this"_ that triggered the old man's enlightenment. Sudden enlightenment doesn't mean enlightenment for free. There's a process at work, and enlightenment is its outcome.


### Emptiness at work.

> "Not falling under the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox? "Not evading the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt a return a human life?

> If you have the single eye of realization, you will appreciate how old Pai-chang lived five hundred lives as a fox as lives of grace.

What has old Paichang done to receive this fruit and live five hundred lives as a fox? What has he done to be released from it today? Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox?

Before and after the turning point are the same. Old Paichang was enlightened but there was __no evasion__, precisely __because__ an enlightened person _"does **not** evade the law of cause and effect"_.

But still, __something__ must have turned, but __what__ ? __What__ could be _"released from the body of the fox"_ ?

> What if he had given __the right answer__ each time he was asked a question -- what would have happened then?"

Yes. What would have happened then? What **then**?

What is the effect of **this** cause? Is there any even?

### Fox drool is still there

> Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox."

No you're not. _"Fox drool is still there."_

### But what is it?

> "Not falling under the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox? "Not evading the law of cause and effect." Why should __this__ prompt a return a human life? If you have the single eye of realization, you will appreciate how old Pai-chang lived five hundred lives as a fox as lives of grace.

Interestingly, the old man and Hyakujo are somehow related. Aitken notes: _"Like most other Zen teachers, Pai-chang was named for his place - in his case the nickname of his mountain (One Hundred Leagues)."_ Since the old man was teaching on that same mountain, he would have had the same name. So in their comment, Wu-men refers to the old man as _"old Pai-chang"_.

What has old Paichang done to receive this fruit and live five hundred lives as a fox? What has he done to be released from it today? Why should __this__ prompt five hundred lives as a fox?

> The old man replied, "I am not a human being. __In the far distant past__, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, __I was__ head priest at this mountain.

The "I" changes every day. Every instant there's a new "I" emerging and an old "I" ceasing. It is the radical impermanence of the Self, dispersed in Indra's Net.  
_"In the far distant past ... __I was__ ..."_ - this is so far in the past, how could there be anything left from the "I" that __was__.  
It has already been dispersed, ceased, renewed, every instant between then and now. A radical change for every instant, not just for a second but for centuries.  
If there's nothing left really, what is the "I" that old Paichang now claims he __was__ (a head priest) back then? If there's nothing left from it, __who__ was reborn five hundred times?

## 4. The ritual

> Making his bows he said, "I am released from the body of a fox. The body is on the other side of this mountain. I wish to make a request of you. __Please__, Abbot, __perform my funerals as for a priest__."  
> [...] After the meal, Pai-chang led the monks to the foot of a rock on the far side of the mountain. And there, with his staff, he poked out the body of a dead fox. He then __performed the ceremony of cremation__.

This ritual might be overlooked as just a mundane step of this story. In his commentary of the koan, Robert Aitken invites us to not skip this ceremony of cremation, especially because it has raised objections by reknown Zen masters.

Indeed, Aitken notes that _"a thousand years later [Hakuin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuin_Ekaku) challenged Pai-chang on this act of cremation: 'What are you doing, old Pai-chang, performing a funeral for a fox as though it were a priest? [...] Aren't you making a mishmash of the Dharma? Isn't a priest irrevocably a priest and a fox irrevocably a fox?'"_

In addition, Dogen criticizes in _Daishugyo_ both the old man for asking for this ritual, and Huakyjo for accepting to perform it.

About the old man, Dogen objects: _"how could a dead fox become a dead monk, since it has never taken the Precepts, or attended a summer retreat, or kept to the everyday behavior of a monk, or held to the principles of a monk? If such a creature may arbitrarily undergo the funeral ceremony for a dead monk, then any dead person who has never left home life behind would have to be accorded the funeral rites of a dead monk too."_

About Hyakujo, Dogen warns: _"Do not treat with arrogance the Dharma standards of the Buddhas and Ancestors by vainly taking as real the transformations of the spirit of some wild fox. As offspring of the Buddhas and Ancestors, you should treat with importance the Dharma standards of the Buddhas and Ancestors. Never leave matters up to what others request, as Hyakujō did."_

> Please, Abbot, perform my funerals as for a priest.

Once you pause to investigate it, many aspects of the old man's request can be challenging.

"**perform my funerals**" - A first interrogation is on the subject of the funeral. The old man just said, _"I am released from the body of a fox"_. Thus himself and the body of the fox are two different things. When requesting for a funeral, is the old man asking for himself or for the fox? Are those two things the same or different?

"**as for a priest**" - A second interrogation is on the nature of the subject. According to his presentation, the old man said _"In the far distant past, in the time of Kasyapa Buddha, I was head priest at this mountain."_ So he *was* a priest, shouldn't he consider himself as a priest now? It sounds like the old man is asking for a funeral not for his distant past self as a priest, but for his previous self as a fox.

"**Please, Abbot**" - A third interrogation is on the motivation of the ritual. At this stage of the story, the old man just got (suddenly) enlightened. Why would the old man care about having a ritual performed for the body of the fox? What is he hoping to accomplish?

> [Hyakujo] then performed the cermony of cremation.

I really hope Hyakujo knows what the old man is hoping to accomplish, because he goes at lenghts to do help.

We have to imagine that this looked like to the monks, having their head master do this.

They hear a surprise strike on the signal board, meaning an improvised funeral. But who? When? There's some interrogation in the community, but the head master just says nothing about it. Then, without any context whatsoever, Hyakujo takes everyone for a long trip to _"the far side of the mountain"_. There, in front of everyone, he pokes a random fox corpse from behind a rock. And then a ritual on that random corpse, not just any ritual, but one that the monks likely have regarded as a highly respectful and important to them. Doing that on a fox? That far out in the mountain? Has the master gone insane? _"What does the teacher mean?"_

Having fun of causality? negating causality?

Why would there be anything to do with the fox's body? What does it __do__ to cremate it? What does it accomplish?

Ritual and liturgy, is that the answer to the question? Is the ritual of cremation the way to find your way between the two answers? Is it the function, the end of Zen practice and liturgy to pay respect to both answers and hold them simultaneously?

### Ritual and enlightenment

And, considering he's said to be "enlightened", does this mean an enlightened being can still be motivated / hope to accomplish anything?

Is the ritual requested by old Paichang, __because__ he understands that an enlightened person __does not evade__ the law of cause and effect? Old Paichang is enlightened, but there are still things that need to happen, and a law that cannot be obscured?
Why does old Paichang even request a funeral? What's the purpose of it from the perspective of Enlightenment?


To address these interrogations, I think it is beneficial to relate them to the two core aspects of the story - the notion of Enlightenment, and the law of cause and effect - and see what this request interrogates.

It doesn't do anything in reality, but it does in the mind, so it does in reality.

The subject of the ritual doesn't make sense.  
The function of the ritual doesn't make sense.  
The benefit of the ritual doesn't make sense.  
Let's do it anyway.

## Unsorted notes

Enlightenment itself is impermanent?

> Huang-po stepped forward and said, "As you say, the old man missed the turning word and was reborn as a fox five hundred times. What if he had given the right answer __each time__ he was asked a question -- __what would have happened then__?"

How many times does one have to answer that question?  
The answer is a distraction, a reflection in the water. The answer old Paichang gave has nothing to do with him being reborn five hundred times as a fox. There is no relationship between that cause and that effect.

## Dogen's slap

_"senior monks who have made mistakes over the past two or three hundred years would certainly have become innumerable foxes."_

Fumai-inga
chapter 73, nishijima, cross
Thirty-seven elements of Bodhi
_Sanjūshichi-bon-bodai-bunpō_

Commenting "The Five Roots of Training"
> "First, the root of faith in the Dharma  
> Second, the root of zealous spiritual endeavor  
> Third, the root of mindfulness  
> Fourth, the root of concentration  
> Fifth, the root of wise discernment."


> "Balance as a root" is keeping one's eyebrows to oneself or "lifting up an eyebrow." This, it is both "not being unclear about cause and effect" and "not falling subject to cause and effect" - and consequently entering the womb of a donkey or entering the womb of a horse. It is like a rock envelopping a jewel: we cannot call it completely rock or completely jewel.

Chapter Eighty-Four, Karma in Three Times (Sanji-no-gō)

"They do not fall into cause and effect" => negating cause 

in Shinjin-inga

> “They do not fall into cause and effect” is just the negation of cause and effect, as a result of which [the negator] falls into bad states. “Do not be unclear about cause and effect” evidently is deep belief in cause and effect, as a result of which the listener gets rid of bad states. We should not wonder [at this], and should not doubt it. Among people of recent generations who profess to be “students of the Way of Zen practice,” most have negated cause and effect. How do we know that they have negated cause and effect? Namely [because] they have considered that “do not fall” and “do not be unclear” amount to the same and are not different. Hence, we know that they have negated cause
and effect.

At this point in my exploration, after a couple of months, I read Dogen's commentary on this case. There are two chapters of the Shobogenzo, one titled "On the Great Practice" (_Daishugyo_) \[[pdf](https://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/073daishugyo.pdf)\], the other "On the Absolute Certainty of Cause and Effect" (_Jinshin Inga_) \[[pdf](http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/088jinshiInga.pdf)\].

### Commentary from _Daishugyo_

> If being reduced to the state of a wild fox was the inevitable consequence of answering a trainee’s question inaccurately, then how many thousands of myriad times would the Rinzais and Tokusans of more recent times, along with their disciples, have been reduced to being wild foxes as a consequence? And apart from them, senior monks who have made mistakes over the past two or three hundred years would certainly have become innumerable foxes.

> If you were to say, “When someone who was a bystander spoke a triggering phrase concerning causality, that freed another from the mind of a wild fox,” well, the great earth with its mountains and rivers has already been giving forth innumerable triggering expressions concerning causality and is continually doing so. But even so, the old man had not yet dropped off the mind of a wild fox in the past, and he only dropped it off due to the later Abbot’s triggering words concerning causality.

> In the old man’s remark, “I was reduced to being reborn as a wild fox for five hundred lives,” what is it that was reborn and what was that reduced to? At the very moment when he was reborn as a wild fox, what form did his previous universe now take on? How is the phrase ‘not being subject to causality’ related to his being reborn five hundred times? And where did the pelt that was now lying beneath a rock on the other side of the mountain come from?

Some notes for myself:
- How could someone dare to judge old and new Paichang's answer as right or wrong?  
- How could there be any causality between old Paichang answering the question and his being reborn as a fox?
- How could there be any causality between Paichang answering the question and old Paichang being enlightened?
- How can a single answer be a turning point?
- How does old Paichang even know he was reborn five hundred lives as a fox? How would a fox know anything about their rebirths? Does the fox know it with the same mind that answered this damning questions?
- Is this whole case just completely wrong? Essentially wrong, being a text, being a **story** with all those causal relationships pointed out, while there are none in the eye of realization?

### Commentary from _Jinshin Inga_

In this one, Dogen clearly considers Paichang's answer ("he is not blind to cause and effect") as the right answer to the question.

> The folks who are the most in the dark are those who do not know that the teaching of not being subject to cause and effect is a false view.

> The later \[Paichang\]’s principle of not being blind to cause and effect means not ignoring the presence of causality. Hence, the underlying principle is clear: we feel the effects of the causes that we put into action. In sum, if you have not clarified what the Buddha’s Dharma is, do not go about recklessly preaching for the sake of the worldly and the celestial. 

>  Undoubtedly, those who deny cause and effect will, in their fierce pursuit of profits, give rise to false views and thereby become people who sever their own good spiritual roots. 

> To summarize, the principle of cause and effect is quite clear, and it is totally impersonal: those who fabricate evil will fall into a lower state, whereas those who practice good will rise to a higher state, and without the slightest disparity.

>  If you deny causality as a result \[not clearing out about cause and effect\], you will experience excessive misfortune, since you would be as ignorant as an ox or a horse. Even if you have not committed any evil act other than denying cause and effect, the poison of this view will immediately be terrible.

## Composing an answer?

After Dogen's slap, I was suggested to focus on the question. I started writing answers that came to me, trying to capture all those glimpses of understanding I had earlier in this process. Still not satisfied with any of those, probably never will be.

## Closing notes

Answering the koan is enacting the law of cause and effect, to translate it into action.

How could one even formulate an answer?  
If one did, and if it was wrong, then they would be reborn as a fox.  
If one did, and if it was right, what would happen then?

Would enlightenment happen?
If there is no evasion, then nothing would happen.  
Cause and effect. What is the answer that has no effect?

Would that one be able to answer the question once more? What between one answer (wrong), and the other? What between one answer (right) and the other? How can it be once more, if it has no effect?

What is "happen"? Cause, effect, cause and effect. What's "and"? "I, **and** the great earth and beings, simultaneously achieve the way".

Like Paichang releasing Old Paichang from the body of a fox, Enlightenment doesn't happen suddenly now, it happens for all past simultaneously.

Closing, for now.
